The first one is to screen out candidates that don't fit. Interviewer was nice and it was a good experience. \n\nJust prep for a week at 2hrs a day on common interview question asked by Microsoft. Search that on youtube and you'll find some experts who go through \"top 25 questions\" or something of that nature. You'll know it when you see it. Good luck and remember to prepare quality answers!",

Completed application after phone call and emailed recruiter to push it to the next step.\r\n3) Completed Codility assessment to qualify for interview event. Three questions, not bad. A couple string questions and exploiting a bug in a given algorithm.\r\n4) Contacted to schedule virtual interview event.\r\n5) Event consisted of four interviews on MS Teams, 45 minutes each. Each interviewer asked behavioral questions and a coding question using Codility.\r\n\r\nThe interview was OK overall. The process was pretty easy to follow and there was lots of communication leading up to it. Took 3 business days following the interview to get my result. My experiences with each interviewer are down below.\r\n\r\nThe first interviewer was very pleasant. Easy question, relaxed discussions on my experience and friendly overall.\r\n\r\nThe second interviewer was about 5 minutes late and was extremely difficult to understand. Spoke very fast and had a thick accent. Seemed a little high-strung There was a bit of a language barrier as he asked me the same behavioral question like three times, all phrased a little differently.\r\n\r\nThe third interviewer was pretty relaxed, similar to the first. Was helpful with answering any questions I had.\r\n\r\nThe fourth interviewer asked the most when it came to behavioral questions. He was very interested in my responses and asked lots of follow-up questions. Was also very nice. Unfortunately, this left only about 20 minutes to solve the tree question he asked. On top of solving it, I was also asked to implement the tree data structure (as shown in the prompt) and add a bunch of test cases to test my algorithm. I felt pretty rushed having to bang this out in 20 minutes, but it's doable if you have practiced a lot with trees and searching algorithms.",

    "review": "I recently changed jobs and had the opportunity to interview with several companies. In total, I had on-site interviews with 7 well known tech companies, including Microsoft. Out of those 7, Microsoft's interview process was the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nI went through their event-based interview process. I was told that I would be interviewed by 4 people, with each person being from a different team, and I would have the opportunity to be recruited by any of those teams.\r\n\r\nThat turned out to be a lie. All 4 of my interviewers were from the same team, and it was a team that I was not interested in joining. I went through the interview anyway, and it was a mess the entire way through.\r\n\r\nFor my first interview, the interviewer was 10 minutes late and didn't even know how to turn on the coding software, so they wasted another 5 minutes trying to figure it out. Eventually, I ended up having to do a screen share and coding in a plain text editor to continue the interview. The coding problem was very easy so I still finished it on time.\r\n\r\nThe second interviewer had a coding problem that was a variation of the first interview, so that was easy to solve. I solved the problem optimally in time and space complexity, but afterwards the interviewer kept telling me to optimize it more. I responded that the solution was already optimal in both time and space, but the interviewer insisted that I over-optimize by short circuiting some loops, even though it wouldn't change the asymptotic running time. I just did what was asked even though it felt like such an odd request.\r\n\r\nThe third interviewer was also late by 5 minutes. Not much else to say here.\r\n\r\nThe fourth interviewer asked me a coding question that I had already solved on Leetcode, so I knew exactly what to do. While I was coding it, the interviewer stopped me and insisted that the way I was doing it wouldn't work. I said that I felt it would work and after some back and forth the interviewer allowed me to continue. Sure enough, I coded it and ran tests through it and it all worked as expected. The interviewer didn't say anything about being wrong.\r\n\r\nCompared to the other 6 interviews I had, this interview with Microsoft was the worst experience. I won't be bothering to interview with Microsoft again.",

The night before the interview, I log in to Teams to make sure it's working - it is. The day of, I log in about 5 minutes before the interview and click the link - and it doesnt work. I try closing/restarting teams, I try changing my internet connection - nothing works. I immediately email the recruiter to let her know and ask for her help. The time for the interview arrives and passes. I continue to try to get into the link. About 10 minutes pass, and I am finally able to get in. The interviewer is not there, she joins a few minutes later and immediately does not give me the benefit of the doubt. I continue to have tech issues - my audio doesn't connect, I need to call in but there is no call in number as I never received a formal insight. The interview begrudgingly sends it over chat. We finally get on and I try to lighten the mood - TECH ISSUES HAPPEN. We all know they've happened over the past year - we've all been through this. \n\nFor the remaining 15-20 minutes of the interview, the interviewer was outright rude. I knew it was over, but I kept a positive attitude, asking about her work and her thoughts on MSFT - showing genuine interest. \n\nWe get off the call, and I notice the recruiter had finally emailed me back saying she could reach out to the interviewer to let them know about the technical issues. I respond back, thanking her, letting her know about the issues and asking for the interviewers email so I could send a thank you for her flexibility. I NEVER heard back - nothing.

Each interviewer has a different area of focus (i.e. Cultural fit, technical aptitude, strategic thinking skills, etc.) The interview questions were reasonable and the individuals conducting the interviews had the level of professionalism that one would expect from a large, Fortune 500 company.\r\n\r\nSo, I completed the interviews over a month ago. I was told pre-interview that I would receive an update within 1 to 2 weeks after completing interviews. Unfortunately, this was not at all accurate. I never received any follow-up communication at all... Absolutely nothing. When I log into Microsoft's application system, my application is in limbo and the status has neither been rejected, nor changed at all since my interview was scheduled. I reached out to the recruiter twice by e-mail, but received no reply at all. Deeply disappointing, rude, and unprofessional behavior on behalf of the recruiter. Definitely not even close to an adequate response after I invested half of a working day interviewing, and actually used my personal vacation time to accommodate the interview time slot. Even being informed that Microsoft just wasn't interested would be better than being left in limbo indefinitely with no update. I have lost all hope of every receiving the courtesy of a response of any kind. Human Resources at Microsoft really needs to re-think making use of the third-party recruiting firm(s) that they use to source candidates and schedule interviews, as the candidate experience is miserable due to being mismanaged by unprofessional third-party recruiters.",

In a week after last interview round I received the offer which was much lower that I expected.

They are under the impression that because Microsoft is a big brand, they can get away by providing minimum information because anyways candidates will still come and give interviews whenever asked. Interviews were cancelled/rescheduled more than 10 times. The process is very slow and takes months. Until you give a call to the recruiter they do not care to schedule your next round, even if you have cleared the previous round. \r\n\r\nInterviewers need to understand that a candidate's whole day is wasted if you cancel the interview at the end time.\r\n\r\nInterviewers ask detailed technical questions for the role of a product manager ex drawing the whole exact architecture, data models etc and reject the candidates even if they are excellent in the product management role. The interviewers were not sympathetic. They didn't even want to listen to your work. They judge you based on technical knowledge for non-technical roles. It is like judging a fish based on its ability to climb a tree.\r\n\r\nPS: I am happy in my current small company.

During the second round, they interviewed only all the girls first, and after their interviews were done, they told the rest of us that we could leave (without giving us the second interview that we were waiting for).\r\n\r\nI feel that if they were planning on only recruiting women, then they could have been upfront about it from the start. Plenty of companies conduct diversity hiring drives and mostly nobody has problems with that. They didn't have to waste everyones time or give us any hope of getting the internship. They tried to make it seem to the rest of the college as if coincidentally all the good candidates they hired were girls, and that there was no bias. But to anyone who was there, it was quite evident that it was rigged. I don't know why they did it in this way. It literally benefitted no one involved.",

Few articulated clearly and could communicate properly but most had very bad communication skills. One even kept giving feedback during the interview which derailed me a lot (and some unwelcome comments too). Common among all was the ego factor. Nothing like other US based companies I have been giving rounds with. In contrast, others dont give feedback and even if you are having the worst interview possible will hold their emotions to themselves.

They looked for my resume and I sent on. Heard nothing for days and had to reach out, few days later got a response saying my CV was passed to hiring manager.  Nothing for days then a mail confirming  they'd like to start process.  Throughout the whole process I never spoke directly with the recruiter.\r\n\r\nI heard nothing for over a week then got a mail asking was I still interested and if I could confirm availability as they were waiting on my response to a mail I never received? That was first alarm bell.\r\nConfirmed availability and recruiting co-ordinator was very helpful and responsive and I was set up with 4 interview on 2 separate days.  Did not receive confirmation of interviews until day before.  reached out to recruiter several times for additional info on what to prep for and basic guidance on Interviewers and potential questions, got no response until day after first interviews.  Response was a copy paste from hiring manager and not helpful. Recruiter asked in mail had my interviews been scheduled...the day after I done 2 for them.  Second alarm bell!\r\nInterviews were tough and fair to a point.  Hiring manger was extremely nice and really sold the role and team and got me really excited about joining a great team and company. General questions about background etc..  2nd round was more role related but Interviewer seemed annoyed I had not done what the previous candidate he had interviewed had done to show I was interested in such a role ( Yep , compared my achievements to another candidate, It was really nice to be ran down like that! ) 3rd Alarm bell and for me a deal breaker, Id never intentionally make little of someone and never want to work with anyone who does.  No feedback whatsoever between  day 1 interviews and day 2 which were held a few days later.    Had expected a mail to say I was not proceeding any further after my 2nd Interview, am still amazed I did not get that as was very clear to me after day 2 I was not what 2nd Interviewer was looking for and would not be a match for role.\r\nDay 2 interviews proceeded anyway. So 3rd round was another PM Interviewer and asked basically same questions previous round had. Asked me exact same question in exact same way and my response was once again, You have read my resume I assume?  Got a very blunt yeah! :-)  Interview was ended very abruptly after about 20 mins which I did not mind as knew I was getting a no.  Last round was pretty ok. I felt it went good, another PM interviewer who seemed genuinely interested in me and my responses and happy with replies I gave. was polite and professional but I did get feeling I was also not what this guy was looking for either. Had a very good conversation however and actually enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nAfter Interview I reached out to recruiter for feedback which I assumed would be an immediate no and thanks for your tome. Got no reply whatsoever and had to chase and chase and eventually copy a colleague on a mail until i got a reply that no feedback received yet.  followed up again and again and no response , eventually a shot mail, No feedback, will update when there is yada yada yada!\r\n\r\nStatus of application on careers site changed to \"not selected\" a few days later and still no communication from recruiter or any feedback despite following up. Oh well, least recruiter was maintaining form.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole process I was polite and professional. I wasn't treated the same way and Its left a bad taste with regard this company for me.\r\nI get I wasn't a match, that's easy to take. \r\nBut the rest, the lack of professionalism, and plain courtesy coupled  with the subtle dig about credentials and accomplishments left me a tad annoyed.\r\nProbably could have avoided a lot of it if recruiter had a quick call with me prior to Interviews to assess role suitability and potential match.\r\n\r\nIf same recruiter ever contacted me again my response would be very unprofessional. It takes zero effort to be courteous and mannerly, it does take effort to be rude.\r\n\r\nLesson learned :-)",

This took place during COVID so it was fully online. I got follow-up from a recruiter the day after applying. I got my first screening interview within a week.  Before that took place, I had a 30 minute phone conversation with my recruiter to talk about any concerns I may have.  The screening interview was a simple chat with a team member, mixed in with a quick competency check. Something that was on the same level as FizzBuzz. If you do okay here, your recruiter follows up within a day or so and you get a series of 4 back-to-back interviews set-up. Another 30 minute conversation with my recruiter before this series of interviews. The interviews were all conducted by the actual team members I would be working with, so it was in my best effort to ask them meaningful questions about the work I would do, and get to know them personally. They were all wonderful, and speaking today, I am proud to work with such an amazing team.\nAnywho, these interviews are 1 hour blocks. Typically the way they would work is the first 15 minutes would be questions they had for you (behavioral, prior experience, etc), the next 30 minutes, you would be solving a technical problem. The cool thing is, is that the interviewer doesn't want to watch you fail and burn. Some of them I had real trouble with, but the interviewer would almost always step in and offer hints or guide me in a productive direction if I was getting off course. In one case, it almost felt like the interviewer and I were discussing and solving the problem as if we were on a team together, and it was something we were assigned. It felt good. The 4th interview at Microsoft is sort of different. You only get it if I believe atleast 2 of the 3 prior interviews had gone well. The 4th interview will be conducted by someone up the chain in your org. In my case, it was my manager's manager, a principle software manager with a PhD, 2 Master's degrees, and 2 bachelor's degrees. This guy, was incredibly intellectual, and let me tell you, no amount of crunching Leetcodes out will have ever prepared me for the hour I spent with him. In the end, it was the most profoundly positive experience I had ever had interviewing with anyone. Period. The questions he had for me felt custom tailored to things he discovered I had personal interest in, and he even taught me a thing or two. It was great.\nAnyways, maybe 4 days later I get a call from my recruiter with an offer. I negotiated a higher offer and received something I was happy with within 3 days.",

I have to agree, the US counterparts at Microsoft are very good to work with as compared to India. Interviewer was fantastic and made me comfortable for the Interview.  Interview went well, and had received very positive feedback from the Interviewer. Questions around my Product Management experience as well as early experience.\r\n\r\nSecond Round, here things got quite messy. Interviewer was from Hyderabad India, and was associated with Microsoft India since long. Since the Interviewer was purely from Technical background, he started asking me only technical questions, with a flavor of coding.  Surprisingly, he grilled me only on my coding skills (which I left 8 years ago), and not my Product Management skills. I was quite surprised, as the Job Description for this role, was not in sync with what the Interviewer was expecting from me.

This was virtual meet with senior members of the teams. I spent days preparing answers for the usual questions, as well as surprises, and did so in STARs format, which is common with the larger tech corps.\n\nThe loop was pretty relaxed (but I was well prepared); I was questioned quite a bit on behavioral scenarios that come with senior positions, working with a team, and contractors. The people were fun and easy to talk to, we joked and shared some common experiences.\n\nAfter all this, I was told by both the studio art director, and the recruiter, that I did extremely well and they would notify me of next steps. Almost a month of back and forth with the recruiter, very positive and reassuring responses, and I found out that I'd lost the position to the other final candidate by just a hair.\n\nWhile I was pretty bummed about getting so much reassurance (I was reassured to the point we were looking at homes to buy in the area), then not getting the position, I can't peg this as a bad experience.

A few days later, the recruiter called and told me that I wasn't being hired for that role but I could interview for a less Tech role. I agreed because I am relocating and need a job and I felt that perhaps I could move up.  But to be honest, I wasn't really all the happy about a Tech role especially since I interviewed for a Sr role. The recruiter/coordinator sent over and confirmed the interview and interview team. However, although I had prepped, there was no real alignment between what I was told and what ended up happening. In the first round, I had to do a hard skills assessment, essentially remote into my recruiter's computer, edit a job posting, conduct a LinkedIn search (including Boolean) and build a pipeline. Nothing wrong with that but the computer (the recruiter's) kept messing up. Also, I haven't done boolean in a while and hoped we would talk about my skills related to this as I could have expanded and explained. The recruiter wasn't even all that friendly. I had it to the final rounds but eventually was told I wasn't going to be made an offer. Mind you that the recruiter didn't bother to call, just send some generic email through the source instead.

Strangely, when I applied it was showing the final date of application but HR came back and said that they have re-posted the role to attract more candidates. \r\nAfter 3 weeks, HR approached that hiring manager liked my CV and want to invite for next round of interview. First round was technical interview/coding continued around 1,5 hours and then 30 minutes gap then second round of interview for design for 1.5 hours on same day. \r\nOverall was OK, but initially set 1 hour but keep asking from me can we extend 30minutes, we want to ask more questions etc. which I found quite unprofessional. Also, conducting 2 interviews at same day, exhausting process to be honest. After interviews, HR called and told me that the interview outcome will be declared after 2 weeks, do you have anything planned for so on so dates (2 dates mentioned) if you are successful. You basically have to fit in their schedule one of those 2 days, putting everything aside to do 2 interviews on same day with different interviewers. \r\nSelected for third round, but it was already too late that all other interviews were on final stages, completed etc. Even though, the processes were started weeks after MS application.\r\nCouple of strange things were noted during/after interview process: HR were keep asking from me which company offer I have got whether it is as big as MS. When I said, not to disclose to her, she mentioned that she can check my status in LinkedIn which I find it quite evil mindset. \r\nAlso, tech design interviewers were not knowledgeable enough about the answers to the questions. Overall a bit long process took 2+ months stage 1, stage 2 to complete and a lot of red flags in very early stage, as an experienced professional, personally I would be hesitant to work as such culture. I have interviewed many other big techies but never experienced such a bureaucratic process. Hopefully, this will help for others who is getting interviewed or considering offer. Thank you.",

Supposedly, I have been pre-screened for the position by a hiring manager within the company a fantastic role and wish I was very interested. I responded to the email which went to a queue at Microsoft. Bad sign #1. I then followed up with the phone number on the email and called the recruiter to make sure that he received my response with interview dates. He confirmed receipt. He ghosted me from that point. Never heard back from him to actually schedule the in-person interview with the \"highly interested\" hiring manager who had supposedly pre-screened my resume for the in-person interview.  Thankfully, I am employed so it wasn't that much of a disappointment. this is a terrible way to do business however for people who are unemployed and actively looking for work. I can only imagine how someone who does not have a job would feel if a top-tier company like Microsoft sent an email like the one I received but had no intention of actually following up. And instead we're \"ghosting\" people. Really bad luck, Microsoft.",

The case study was the basis of the presentation that needed be 30-45 minutes long and then allowing for questions at the end.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd stage interviews were split into 2 parts:\r\n1) Presentation - Technical Peers\r\n2) Management Interview - Team manager and a peer\r\n\r\nThe Presentation was a role play to treat the peers as the customer and you in the role that you were applying for, managerial was more traditional interviews trying to match questions to the corporate values.\r\n\r\nTook a few days to get very detailed feedback, however the feedback clashed with what the overall answer was. One of the pieces of feedback was that I was able to give good real-world examples to qualify experience and yet I wasn't hired because I was unable to provide adequate examples of real world scenarios!",

This was the only interviews and decision would be made after this. The Hiring Manager was also one of the interviewers. \n\nI finally got an update after 4 weeks from the recruiter that the team recommended me for hire, but there was no headcount with the team so they could not extend the job offer.  It was frustrating for such a reputed company to not have a headcount but advertise the position as open. No proper updates or communication as well from the recruiter. I thankfully got a different offer in the meantime, and I understand MFST is a big company and competition is fierce, but Microsoft takes such a long time to make a decision compared to other FAANG companies.

I show up 5 minutes early and no one attended the meeting. I wait for an hour, and sent a couple of mails, and nothing happened. One week later they show up tellingbme that the position was closed for LATAM, that he could transfer me to a job position in other team that could hire someone from LATAM, and that he would send me the OTS next day. I'm still waiting, I sent emails but no response, a complete waste of time and the discouragement of being stood up",

Never heard from her again, was ghosted by Microsoft! To add to this, this week a recruiter reached out on LI re: a similar role. When I asked him was it the same team, and told him I didnt hear back from the Director above, he came back to say \"We are currently in process for other candidates but I'll come back to you should we be interested in progressing you further and then we can discuss the role in more detail.\" He sourced me on LI, so I was pretty surprised with his response simply for letting him know about my recent experience.",

But none of them belittled me for not giving right answers. I would highly recommend everyone to experience technical interview process with Microsoft.\r\nI got a mail from HR next week saying, I will be having final interview with research manager. It was cancelled on the last day. HR re-scheduled the final interview with another research manager. And on the day of my final interview, I received an automation mail from Microsoft that \"we will not be moving forward with your candidacy for the position of Security Researcher\". I dropped a mail to HR and he too responded back saying he never received any note that the interview has been cancelled.Later HR told they will get back with more information but no response from them even after I mailed them twice asking for an update.\r\n\r\nThe whole interview process took one complete month.All I needed was one response from HR team on the closure.It is not good to keep candidates hanging like this. \r\nIt would have been better if HR had some basic manners of informing the candidate on the situation.\r\nPlease attend MS technical interviews for good interview process experience.

This initial chat was actually quite pleasant. The recruiter, however, was based in a different country. This meant he would need to pass me to a local recruiter if I were interested in proceeding. I said this was fine, and off we went.\r\n\r\nThis is where it all starts going awry.\r\n\r\nWe schedule a call for the new year given that there wasn't much time left in the year. The recruiter proposed a few options and I selected one.\r\n\r\nThe time comes for the call and the recruiter is nowhere to be seen. I email him. I get an OOO message as a response. I love plot twists, but this one seemed a lot like some pretty lazy writing.\r\n\r\nThe next day he apologises and we reschedule.\r\n\r\nThe day of the call comes, and we chat. He tells me about the role and I ask a few probing questions to make sure it sounds right to me. At the end of the call, we agree that the next steps are for him to send me some more details on the role and I will respond with my full resume (he had already looked at my LinkedIn).\r\n\r\nAfter the call, he sends an email (at 9:00pm - Microsoft certainly seems to have some strange working hours these days) with some more details about the role. I respond that it sounds good and I'm comfortable to proceed. I attach my resume.\r\nNo response.\r\n\r\nA few days later I follow up to see whether there's anything to be done.\r\nNo response.\r\n\r\nA week later, I follow up to ask whether this is still going ahead.\r\nNo response.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it has been two weeks following the last contact with the recruiter. I can only assume that one of the following is true:\r\n- he learnt all of his communication skills from Tinder and has become a professional ghoster;\r\n- the fate of the world hinges on my not getting this job; or\r\n- he's just a terrible recruiter.\r\n\r\nNot sure which.",

I received an e-mail around 3 weeks later, which stated that a Microsoft recruiter took interest in my application and would like to invite me to a first-round 30-minute interview. The role which I would be interviewing for was not mentioned, and neither was the location. This was a little odd to me, as my classmates who went through the same process had first-round interviews that lasted 2 hours long and the location and role they were interviewing for were made crystal clear to them before their interview. I chalked it off to a procedural change due to COVID, since my interview was remote but theirs were on-site. \r\n\r\nThe interviewer I had was late to the interview, was highly distracted and paused the interview on a few occasions to reply to work e-mails for at least 2 minutes each time. All part of remote work, I thought to myself, and tried to show my understanding and empathy. The interview thus lasted way less than 30 minutes. We did not get to go through my resume completely, even though I have 3 years of PM experience, 3 years of Operations experience as a Manager and 2 years of Sales experience, all in tech companies. I was not asked any behavioural or technical questions either. Not even asked about what I know about Microsoft and what the responsibilities of those roles entailed and how I saw myself fitting into those roles (I have previously chatted with several Microsoft staff to understand what those roles required). Received an e-mail from another recruiter (not my original one) 5 weeks later saying that I would not be made an offer.",

Really practice talking about your projects and the teamwork within your projects. Within the next week (usually takes longer but only took me a week) they contacted me scheduling a virtual on-site.\r\n\r\n(October 2020) Interviewed at the very start of October with the (seemingly) randomly decided team in Azure. 4 interviews: 1. A Software Manager asking about projects and technical decisions within projects. Technical question was variation of common BST-related problem asked by Microsoft. 2. SWE asking about projects and teamwork. Technical question was Meeting Rooms 2. 3. Software Manager asking system design question. Fairly lax since New Grad, so just talk about things you would consider when building the system (how to make things scalable, what databases to have, important features). Question was about cloud services product design. 4. Normally called the AA meeting, only for people who did well, but for virtual interviews they seem to give this to everyone no matter what. With Senior manager who likely makes the ultimate decision based on feedback prior. Asked about your interests and past experience. Checks if you are match for the team. Technical question was along the lines of longest palindrome substring. \r\n\r\nReceived offer several weeks later due to delays (late October). Was great experience.

Also, to avoid surprises, check the team lead profile\r\n- cross-check the job position and your experience.

The interview process lasted a full day with 3 rounds of an hour each primarily focussing on product thinking and customer empathy. In case the 3 rounds went well, a final round with the hiring manager would be scheduled later in the day. \r\n\r\nEach round of the process was taken by senior people in Product Management, with the HM being a director. The process was well organised with clear expectation setting at the beginning of each round. Rather than a series of questions followed by answers, the interviewers made it more conversational and gave me a sense that I was also evaluating Microsoft while Microsoft was evaluating me.\r\nOne thing that was clear from the process was that if I got the job, I would be working with really smart people and that excited me the most.",

(For eg.- 102 will be given as 1 -> 0 -> 2 ). Add these no.s and return the answer in the form of a singly linkllist. Do it in O(n) time, given n digit numbers\r\nG\r\n4th Round \u2013 Interview\r\nI had to implement a T9 dictionary . insertWord function and populateWords were the two functions which I had to implement on paper(again no pseudo code).\r\nFirst I have to discuss the approach with the interviewer and then he asked me to code.\r\n\r\n5th Round \u2013 Interview\r\n\r\nHe dicussed the work that I did in my last summer internship and after that he asked me to code the maximum subarray problem in one pass.",

I was specifically asked to share the whole screen and not just one window.\r\n\r\nContrary to what recruiter made me believe, both the rounds were SRE centric Trivia and to most of the questions I kept responding that I didn't have enough knowledge on those topics. Interviews ended soon enough after some basic programming questions.\r\n\r\nOverall experience: \r\n1. The recruiter's info was misleading. Representing Microsoft it'd be the poorest professionals I've come across.\r\n2. One of the panel on the call itself informed me that I'd be better suited for Backend role than SRE. When I said I was hoping for it to Backend centric role, the panel said he'll inform about this to the recruiter. Generally it's not wise to communicate the feedback by the panel. The panels were not trained for interview process.\r\n3. Both the panels as mentioned in another Glassdoor post: were at the same level they were hiring for. Which creates prejudice. Most of the time panels overlapped and cut me off while I was speaking. Picked one word from my response and asked next questions without even letting me finish.\r\ne.g: \r\nQ. How does redis Ensure persistence?\r\nA. Data is kept in-primary memory but it allows snapshots to be taken at...\r\nQ. What is a snapshot?",

This interview was very different from what I was used to. Essentially I was asked to describe my solutions to 2  semi-easy coding questions. \n\nAfter surviving that I had a virtual on-site interview with 5 different interviewers.

My 5th and final interview of that session was with the Hiring Manager, and this is probably where I ended up falling short. This particular manager was the head of a team that was particularly focused on customer satisfaction.\n\nThe rejection email said this:\n\n\"...you performed well like coding and problem solving, but didn\u2019t meet expectations in areas like adaptability and customer focus which are critical competencies for our engineering teams to be successful\"\n\nNot entirely sure what that means but I guess that's why I'm not Microsoft material.",

    "review": "I am writing this to describe the absolutely nightmarish time I had during the Microsoft student recruitment process. I was assaulted three times, the first two times were in the space of me being in the Microsoft building for just 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nI passed the online stages for the Microsoft student recruitment as I was looking for a paid industry placement during my sandwich year, and what happened to this day has left me shaken. I have worked at Deloitte which is known for a rough culture, startups, and even governmental organisations but nothing compares to the scum I encountered that day.\r\n\r\nHaving just rejected a job with Apple and a startup company, along with having had employment in the past, I entered their offices for the assessment day. As other candidates were talking I walked over, except everyone immediately stopped talking and began staring at me as if I was responsible for having committed some atrocity to their families. It was at this moment that an Indian gentleman squeezed between people to get to me, tripping me up to the extent that I hit the floor and struggled to get back up from the impact. I was both shocked and confused by what had just happened, I was only in the Microsoft offices for 20 seconds, but thought perhaps it had been an accident. \r\n\r\nThe other candidates had resumed their conversation on video games, but blocked me out of their circle and refused to interact with me. I saw a girl just outside of the circle that appeared also left out, and probably unable to contribute to the conversation as it was on video games (not trying to be sexist). I tried to make conversation with me, to which she replied \u201cOH MY GOSH ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?! YOU ARE A PEASANT\u201d in an extremely loud scream, with a face that looked like she had just accidentally bitten on a sour lemon thinking it was an apple, and gave the impression that she was the Queen of India and I was the peasant garden boy. With her hand movements my face and arms received some mild cuts from her nails. I tried to calm the situation down but I was completely and utterly ignored, she was too self-important.\r\n\r\nBy this point my temper had begun to flare, from the shock I swore pretty loudly in front of Microsoft recruitment people, however this girl did not react in the slightest. We all ended up walking into an office where we would be interviewed as a group.\r\n\r\nFoolishly I decided to go first and present an object that I had brought in, when I should have let myself recompose after the trauma of what I had just experienced outside. After my presentation I lost my temper. Fortunately, Microsoft did not kick me out as they had guessed something had just happened outside, and told me to go again.\r\n\r\nAt one point I explained that there was a difference between Java and JavaScript, however a candidate (the one that tripped me up outside) encouraged everybody to laugh at me saying that they were the same thing. After I politely tried to explain the difference, stating that Java is a strongly typed language compared to JavaScript which is loosely typed, I was laughed at again. I told the candidate that he had just got a car confused with a carpet, to which everyone rolled on the ground laughing.\r\n\r\nDespite everything, I ended up talking for almost four hours, showing off my knowledge and essentially cleaning the floor with everyone else. Many lacked even the most basic computer science knowledge, such as what a pointer was used for. This made the gentleman who had assaulted me mad, whereas the girl that assaulted me just looked out of the window the whole time as she was too self-important (except one occasion when she spoke to me as she strangely did not know that a hex editor could edit text within a .EXE file).\r\n\r\nThe candidates through everything at me testing my knowledge, however in the end one \u201clawyer trick\u201d was used against me and I unfortunately took the bait and lost all credibility with Microsoft. The gentleman that assaulted me earlier did a trick to bamboozle me, where he would explain a scenario in a long, complex, and complicated manner so only myself and perhaps two other people could understand. He would then ask a simple question, such as the colour of the sky, but given his scenario I would be backed into a corner and forced to say purple, instead of blue. This destroyed the entire day, as the candidates began fighting one another, and Microsoft thought we were all stupid.\r\n\r\nAfter, when we were outside playing ping pong all of the candidates tried to gang up on me, and the one that assaulted me earlier punched me in the face. They were butt hurt that I had made them look stupid when they could not answer simple Computer Science questions, such as what a PE file was.",

This has to be the most frustrating interview experience ever.\r\n\r\nFirst step: online assessment. Fairly easy. But this is where the frustration started. It took 1+ week to get back to me with the results. I mean, I passed every test case and such, why was I not automatically passed to the next round? After following up with the recruiter multiple times for a week got an email saying I'm moving to onsite.\r\n\r\nSince this was a hiring event, date was already set. However, I didn't get confirmed for the event until ONE DAY before. ONE DAY. I had to take a leap of faith in taking time off for the interview with recruiter completely unresponsive. So unprofessional.\r\n\r\nOnsite consisted of 4 interviews, 45 mins each with 15 min break in between. All virtual via Teams. Oh they had this kickoff call at 7:30 in the morning. And it was just a Teams meeting with all interviewees in the room. Lol just awkward. No one knew what the hell they were doing there. I left after 10 mins. To this day I have no clue what that was supposed to be, and why I had to get up and ready by 7:30am. Mind you timezone was same as I was a local candidate. Actual interviews were great, interviewers professional and courteous. Had a good interview experience.\r\n\r\nGot email 1 week after that I passed the interview and was moving forward with the offer. This is where another fun begins. Lots of emails back and forth, which could have been 1 single email, tossed between multiple recruiters (why? I don't know. I dealt with total of 6 recruiters for the entire process), long story short it took 3 weeks to get a verbal offer.\r\n\r\nOh and then, once I sign it, background check. So, for some reason, we are not allowed to know the results nor the progress of our own background check due to confidentiality.  What? Ok. They use HireRight to carry out this work, and they are downright incompetent. They took 3 weeks to tryverifying my education and work history. And the best part is, they still couldn't do it so I did it for them by reaching out and getting paychecks to verify it myself. All this took me 2 hours. They took 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined, I really had to try hard and separate all this BS from the actual opportunity. I mean Microsoft, you really have to work on your interview experience.

It was all telephonic due to the lockdown period.\r\n\r\nThe interview panel consisted of two rounds and each round had two people. Usually one was actively asking questions and another was passive.\r\n\r\nFirst round went for 1 hour. They joined a bit late. First 15 mins was about typical \"tell me about yourself\" and then a few technical questions on performance, approach etc. And then there was a layout problem to be solved. All that they asked was approach. Not the working code. It went well. He said the recruiter will share the feedback on what went well and what didn't.\r\n\r\nSecond round also went on for 20 mins where they introduced themselves and asked for my introduction. A couple of questions on technologies used and how comfortable I am with those frameworks etc. Only one of them was interactive all through and the other was not. He asked me to open redbus.in and develop the calendar that is visible there. I asked questions on, should the leap year be considered, alternative month days etc. After I coded for 20 mins he said to concentrate on the logic part. Till then I was coding different templates for days/row/week row etc. I was not even aware that there was time limit, they didn't tell me. I completed the logic part. The active interviewer was answering the questions and following the logic that I was writing. But as the one hour got over, the other interviewer who was silent till then pitched in and said execute the code because it is time up as they have other interviews to be taken. I hadn't even linked my .js files, .css file to html file. I am comfortable in local ide rather than repl. Obviously it didn't work. So he asked the active interviewer who was interacting, \"ain't you leaving the call? I am leaving\" I left the call immediately before even they left. It took 5 mins for me after the interview to make it work perfectly.\r\n\r\nThen on the next day, recruiter sent me a mail saying they are discontinuing the process with my profile. No elaborated feedback on to what went wrong. So, it was a kind of disappointment for me to spend so much effort and time to not recieve a proper feedback.\r\n\r\nTo guys who have read this before your microsoft front end interview, one concentrate on completing the problem. Probably they are not looking for the code quality because no one can develop a calendar in 40 mins with good quality. And good luck!",

Pretty informal, discussing your experience, your understanding of the PM role, why you like MS and then some design questions, such as \"design a smart clock\". Basically looking for your design thinking and thought process.\r\n\r\nInvited to onsite about two weeks later. 4 interviews, each with current PM's of varying seniority. They'll say its 3 interviews initially, but if you do well in the first 3 they'll add the 4th with the hiring manager PM. Each interview followed very much the same pattern, start with small talk and questions about your background, your experience, behavioral questions like 'tell me about a time when you showed leadership/worked in a team/ resolved a conflict/solved a technical challenge'. That would take about 5-10 minutes, and then the remaining 30+ would be designing something. \"Design a smart cupboard/ an app for the elderly to encourage increased physical movement in nursing homes/ a smart car entertainment system.\"\r\n\r\nThey're really just looking for a process, that you're methodical in how you solve problems and understand the importance of asking questions first and identifying the parameters/constraints of what your product should and shouldn't include. Don't dive straight in, ask clarifying questions, listen to their feedback as you're talking through the process out loud, and make sure you use the whiteboard. Wire framing is your friend. Ask questions of the interviewer as you think of them, right throughout the process.\r\n\r\nOverall process was fine, repetitive if anything. Younger interviewers were pleasant and enthusiastic, more senior ones seems hard to impress and very much like they'd better things to be doing, very stoic and standoffish. Just depends on who you get.\r\n\r\nIt's a long tiring day, so eat before hand and hydrate well during it, you're doing most of the talking so your voice could get hoarse.\u00a0",

    "review": "After working with a msft recruiter for a month or two, they forwarded a job description and asked if I was interested. I'm a publicly recognized leader in my field - the job description was almost a 100% match - so close, I asked the recruiter if it had been written with me in mind. With the \"Partner\" designation, of course I was interested.\r\n\r\nAfter an initial M&G and a round of interviews, there was a clear fit and obvious interest on both sides. I had worked with and had a good relationship with people on the interview panel. The hiring manager gave me a list of books to read that \"I usually only give after we've made the offer.\" This was all but done. And then everybody went silent.\r\n\r\nAfter a week or so I pinged the recruiter to see what was going on. On a catch-up call I was informed that an internal candidate had been selected. He didn't have my skills, but he knew how Microsoft worked. This is what you should prepare yourself for - especially over level 67. I've since talked to many, and watched other execs deal with senior level politics at msft. The backstabbing, reorgs, and land grabs are constant and olympic-level jackassery. That the top 5 or so execs in the company haven't put a stop to this, while Satya grins publicly and talks about all the change that's happened in his book - this should tell you something.\r\n\r\nIf you're happy joining at a lower level and climbing the ladder, sitting in your cube and keeping your head down - yes, Microsoft is a great company to work for. If you're a go-getter who's hungry, wants to make massive changes and not deal with cancer that senior execs desperately need to cut out of the company, avoid this company.\r\n\r\nYes - I'm extremely bitter. I was massively excited to join. In hindsight I dodged a bullet but I'd love to help others avoid that experience if at all possible. I've stayed in touch with many inside the company, and paid more attention to the inner workings than I had previously. If I knew a year ago what I know now, I wouldn't return the recruiters call.\r\n\r\nBefore you interview - but definitely before you take a position - befriend a L67 or higher who's been there at least 18 months. There's lots of positives at Microsoft - but make sure they tell you a few stories in the trenches, as well.",

I emailed the recruiter the day after passing the online assignment asking for some guidance on materials to prepare for the onsites, no answer, I got an email from him with some prep material the evening before the interview! 5 days after the onsite I got a call from the recruiter saying that I wasn't selected for this role but that they had another opening that might fit me better and encouraged me to re-interview right away, I declined the offer and asked to get some feedback from my onsites on areas to improve, recruiter didn't have the feedback at the time but said I should be receiving it by email in the next day. That was 3 weeks ago, still waiting...\r\n\r\nAs for the onsites, I had 4 hours of technical interviews, 3 on DS and Algs 1 on Systems Design, interviewers where really nice and helpful, the problems where about medium leetcode difficulty. One of the interviewers seemed a bit shocked when I said I was gonna do the challenge in python, ( this was already determined since day 1 when I spoke with the recruiter) and seemed to be improvising the challenge as we went, which made the whole thing pretty confusing, so that didn't feel great.\r\n\r\nOverall the onsite experience was positive, but recruiting process was one of the worst I ever experienced",

The phone screen interview was very pleasant and relaxed, the interviewer was super nice. After this,  I was contacted a few days later from the recruiter saying I am being moved onto onsite in Microsofts office in Dublin.

On interview day, I had seven back to back rounds of interviews. Almost everyone asked the same questions except the last managerial and first managerial round.  All the interviewing panel carried the pride of the company brand and they clearly showed off that they are smarter by asking a lot of coding algorithms. It appeared that they never used those algorithms in their day to day tasks. And of course, all the interview panel were desi guys. Obviously, they acted over smart by showing their extra preparation for the interview.  They do not even know the basic concept of giving breaks between interview rounds. In the end, the manager interview clearly showed that their work culture is bureaucratic. They don't like someone who asks too many questions.",

    "review": "I initially submitted my application for the Microsoft Explorer role around August/September of 2019, and had an in-person interview at my university for first rounds in October. It was half behavioral, half technical, and I honestly think I choked on the technical part. However, I received an invitation to fly out for final rounds a month later, but my only options for dates were far off, which worried me because Explorer spots run out fast and it's better to do final rounds as early as possible. I flew out early February and interviewed on-site (pretty sure I was in the last group of interviews of the year for Explorer- yikes). I had two interviews- one PM and one technical, and for both interviews, half of the time was spent on behavioral/resume, and the other half on a question. I thought I did really well on the PM interview and alright on the SWE one (I don't want to reveal my interview questions, but I will say that when I searched up my SWE question on Leetcode, it was a Leetcode hard question- so even though I didn't think I did that well on that problem, I think they just asked me it to see how I think, not if I could solve it given the time constraint). I told them about my offer deadline for another company that was coming up and they promised to get back to me before then. They emailed me the day of the deadline letting me know that they were extending an offer to me, but the formal offer was not prepared yet, so they were just letting me know ASAP so I could deal with my other deadline. The formal offer letter arrived a couple of days later. Overall, I had a great experience- the Microsoft interviewers were hands down the nicest interviewers I've ever had, and I could tell they genuinely cared about getting to know me and sharing our work with each other. Microsoft isn't looking for the strongest coders ever for this role- they're looking for people passionate about what they're working on and who know what they are working towards in the future. I'm definitely not the best coder, but I am passionate about my work and about empowering other women in the field, and I think my expressiveness about this made the interviewers like me more and think I could be a good fit for the team.",

    "review": "This interview was for AI cognitive science org at Microsoft in Sunnyvale. One recruiter reached out to me and the recruiter recommended AI cognitive science org for me based on my background. I cleared the online assessment and I was told that I will be moving to onsite interviews next. But that did not happen. First recruiter (recruiter 1) handed off the process to another recruiter (recruiter 2) who told me that hiring manager wants to do a phone screen first. The hiring manager kept procrastinating for 2-3 weeks and finally agreed to interview me. The phone screen interview with hiring manager went well and they immediately told me that they want to move to onsite rounds. They cancelled my onsite rounds 2 days before for some random reason which they did not disclose and told me that they want me to come to Bellevue and interview for there. I agreed and went to Bellevue for the onsite interviews. On the day of onsite interviews, I met my 2nd interviewer initially and my 2nd interviewer (who was gonna conduct the lunch interivew) told me that they had not booked conference rooms for 2 interviews. This was weird. I did my first interview in some temporary conference room. It went well. I had a break in between my 1st round and 2nd round. In this break, they told me that I am supposed to sit in that conference and not roam around. I sat in that conference room for 5-10 minutes and suddenly 10 people showed up with for scrum meeting. Apparently the team which I was interviewing for did not book the conference rooms at all. They kicked me out of the conference room. I had to spend my break time in the kitchen area. After my break, I told the 2nd interviewer about what happened. The 2nd interviewer was smiling and I felt that he knew about this but he was trying his best to hide it. The 2nd interview was supposed to be the lunch interview but he completely forgot about \"lunch\" part and took me to his workstation and started asking me whiteboard coding questions. I solved the question and gave him optimal solution. When 20 minutes were left, he suddenly remembered the \"lunch\" part and basically told me to finish my lunch in about 20 minutes. My last interview was a system design interview with hiring manager. The hiring manager works from Sunnyvale but they called me for onsite interviews in Bellevue. They do not have any team members in Bellevue then why invite me there. This was extremely strange. Moreover, the hiring manager joined the interview session via audio call and did not even show me his face. I solved the design question and the hiring manager said that I did a great job overall. I received an automated reject 1 day after. Funniest part of this process was recruiter 2 was hiding under the name of \"conference\" and basically did not even care to join the prep call. So, I never got a chance to talk to recruiter 2 in the entire process. Even the amount the expenses that they have reimbursed (which is less than the approved amount) does not match the amount that they have approved. Clearly they set me up with some fake interviewing process when they were not even interested. Such a waste of time! Rude people! On the other hand, I am glad because I do not want to be a part of such a  team/org where they do not respect people.",

Then around one weeks later I heard that I was waitlisted for interview spots, but eventually (maybe two more weeks later) they offered to fly me out to a final interview in Washington.\r\n1. The Campus Interview\r\nThe campus interview was fairly straight forward. They asked me a something that tested data structures. I didn't actually catch on the the interviewer wanted me to use a hash table for a bit but he was really patient with me and encouraging. He then asked me how I felt about the Tesla touchscreen displays in the cars and asked me to why touchscreen or traditional knobs might be better or worse.\r\n\r\n2. The Final Round\r\nThe final round consisted of four interviews each around 45 minutes. There were no coding questions unless you were coming from a non-computing major (I chatted with a bunch of the other interviewees and that's the conclusion we'd come to since the only two non-computing were the only two who got technical questions).\r\nMy first round asked me about any projects I've worked on. I mentioned one from a previous job and he grilled me on my design choices in the project (though it was a basic intern project with the design choices already made for me so he asked me how I would have designed it). He then asked me some general questions about if I were given a product and a team what would I do. He narrowed the question down as I asked clarifying questions.\r\nMy second round interviewer began by pointing out the same project on my resume from my previous job and asked about the design choices again.\r\nMy third round began by saying she spoke to my previous interviewer and wanted to hear about my project from my previous job (tbh at this point I really wish I could have talked about something else). Luckily, this interviewer decided to go off the original problem my project was solving and asked for a larger scope how would I solve the problems.\r\nMy fourth round was the most fun. He asked about an app I use a lot. I mentioned Spotify. He had me try to improve the product coming up with three new features. He then asked for a big new change for Spotify.",

I tested the system with an attempt at the gaming position (because I\u2019ve only been playing video games for almost 20 years) and they had a question about whether I worked professionally with video game troubleshooting for over a year. I guess not so maybe I would have had to work at GameStop? Anyway I got an automated rejection email a day later just to see how the system worked.\n\nSo I received an email about a week after my application for the Part Time Product Advisor position from a recruiter with a \u201cphone screen\u201d questionnaire. Here\u2019s the kicker, I thought it was fake! The email was full of typos and the email looked different from the ones directly from Microsoft. I never got a phone call yet either. I did loads of research for the questions and to test if it was all legitimate. I tried calling the Microsoft Store I applied to and got stuck with the automated assistant and Google was no help. Even job sites like this one lacked people in my situation. I typed out the questions in the table format she sent me and sent them off just to see what happened. I waited a week and got no response. I found her on LinkedIn instead just to update her on my employment availability which became open later in the month after my seasonal job ended. \n\nLo and behold, I actually received a call though because I was still hesitant, I truly did not know it was her until it was too late and I got the voicemail. She was calling from California I think which spooked me. The call was unanswered and now that I think about it, perhaps it could have helped me get the job.\n\nThat weekend I actually got a missed call and voicemail from the Microsoft Store I applied to but it was a different number than what I called initially. Luckily, I got a follow up email immediately and it turned out the Assistant Manager was trying to schedule an interview for next week. \n\nA team member greeted me and welcomed me into the store on the interview day. He offered me a bottle of water after I told him I was here for an interview. I then waited for a few minutes at a nice gaming PC station until the Assistant Manager greeted me. I was startled but he seemed like a nice guy. He also offered me a bottle of water. The back room looked a bit like the Apple Store. I was pleasantly surprised that I was in a 1-on-1 interview and not a panel as described by most people who reported interviews for Microsoft.\n\nI felt that things were going well again until the interview. I think even though I studied for a month for this position, because I was late and in a panic to get there thanks to unreliable transportation, I forgot much of everything. I didn\u2019t even show him my questionnaire or harp on about Microsoft and Xbox like I have initially. He didn\u2019t really ask me to elaborate on my skills and what qualifications I have outside of that pesky retail and past job experience. I ended the interview early without closure. I went home worried and confused as well as tired but I had to come up with a thank you email ASAP.\n\nNow I waited about 10 days just like the job sites recommended which was silly because by the time it reached day 10, in the middle of my follow up email with the recruiter, I was already denied the job before the automated email told me as I checked the career site and I expressed that in my message. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because I really didn\u2019t qualify or if I should have replied earlier. I can say though it must have gone well enough because it took nearly half a month for them to deny me as opposed to just over the weekend. I could always try again down the line.",

It started off with a phone interview in which a recruiter read me questions and then wrote down my answers (not responding to them at all, merely pausing so he could write down what I was saying). Then I got invited to the final interview and I set up all the travel and got my flight booked. About a week later I got another email inviting me to the interview, and I responded saying I had already RSVPd but was there anything else they needed from me. They wrote back saying they had cancelled that interview and wanted me to come in three days earlier (which I would not have known had I not responded to the email). This new date was very inconvenient for me so I emailed back asking if it was possible to reschedule, and after a couple follow up emails, they finally replied on Friday in the middle of the night that there was no other possible date, and I had to come in on Tuesday (I live across the country). Their travel team only works monday through friday so they ended up booking my flight a couple hours before I had to leave. Nevertheless I reschedule my prior commitments and show up to the interview only to learn that they had changed the position I was interviewing for (even though I had asked to confirm several times if it was for the same position and they had said it was). I also found  out during the last interview that they had my resume from last year. They then told me that I would receive my results within two weeks, but took a month to get back to me, rejecting me. At that point I was so tired from the experience, I had lost nearly all interest in the position. It's a shame because I had interviewed the year before for an internship and had a very positive experience, but this time around I felt more like just a number than I had ever felt before.",

Each round was less than 30 minutes and very short. Not sure if it is because I gave the answer rightaway or because the interviewers were not interested (seemed like it). \r\n\r\nFirst round : \r\n\t1. Tell me about yourself\r\n\t2. About my current work and job.\r\n\t3. Then asked one coding question : Rotate array. \r\n\tHe asked to propose any solution first, and then optimise it. I said I have encountered this question and know the optimal solution with O(n) time and O(1) space. He asked to explain solution and then code it. \r\n\tOnce I completed - he asked to do unit test and say few test cases - I did it. \r\n\tThat was it. \r\n\r\nSecond round : \r\n\t1. Few questions about my current work and job\r\n\t2. One coding question : Clone LL with random pointer : \u00a0\r\n\tI had not known this question before and I came up with hashing based implementation . The interviewer asked me to write it down, and once done he asked me for alternative implementations. \r\n\tI suggested two other methods all with O(n) extra space - but he wanted with O(1) extra space. I could not come up with it and was asked to leave. \r\n\r\nOther people who interviewed with me got the following questions : \r\n1. Implement singleton design pattern\r\n2. clone circular Linked List \r\n\r\nOverall interview experience was very bad. I had to wait for more than 7 hours just to give 30 minutes of interview. \r\nThe interviewers did not discuss or participate in problem solving - once I solved the given problem, interview was over. Also they seemed very disinterested in the entire interview process. \r\nHR co-ordination was also very bad. Both interviewers did not have my resume and had some one else's resume - so it was irritating. \r\n\r\nMajor focus was on array, Linked List and design.\u00a0",

The team asked me some specific questions about how I would add features in Microsoft Academic Graph. After this, during the second hour, they asked me an architecture question which I did very well on. Then they asked me to write the code for a specific data structure, going conceptually through the characteristics of this particular data structure with me, after a while telling me to write it in pseudo-code. I felt like I did pretty well up until this point, though I had felt that I didn\u2019t implement the data structure completely.\u00a0 (They later told me that I didn\u2019t pass the interview because I didn\u2019t write complete code in C++ for this data structure). \r\n\r\nWhat bothered me about this interview process however was that during the lunch interview my interviewer asked me a lot of very personal questions that were completely unrelated to the job. I told her about how I used to take care of children, and she told me that I should go back to doing that instead of being a Software Engineer. Furthermore, during the lunch interview the interviewer only consumed a single banana, and threw the rest of her food away. I strongly felt that, due to the nature of the questions that she was asking, and her generally condescending attitude toward me this was some sort of racist dig toward me (I am an underrepresented minority).\r\n\r\nGoing through this experience and watching her eat the banana while making chiding jokes about how I shouldn\u2019t be a Software Engineer was completely humiliating, unprofessional and made this interview ultimately a waste of my time. Because of this, I keep a strongly negative impression of Microsoft as a company. There was another interview after this, but it was with the same person, and I felt completely uncomfortable about the entire thing. After this I was a pencil as a \u201cparting gift\u201d.\r\n\r\nIf this was some kind of a joke I am definitely not amused. Out of CS graduates with Computer Science degrees, Microsoft tends to not hire women and underrepresented minorities, including women of color such as myself. Microsoft should do better, including hiring interviewers that are sensitive to their own bias and blind spots, and who definitely don\u2019t openly make fun of people. Furthermore, If they wanted me to implement the code, which was far more than 8 lines (the GeeksforGeeks.com implementation of this data structure in C++ is no less than 50 lines of code for instance) then it would be good to specifically tell the candidate to implement that data structure in actual code, in order to guide them in the right direction as opposed to the wrong one, even if the requirements somehow can\u2019t be made clear for specific reasons during the interview itself.",

During the phone interview I was told the next step would be a technical interview over the phone but he wasn't able to schedule on the spot. Was told he would contact me but never received another message.\n\nThis was by far the worse experience I ever had interviewing for a company. Not only he did not give me an opportunity to share my professional experience but also wanted to \"coach\" me in what I should and should not say. One of his recommendations was that I should not mention my age and wanted to tell me everything he wanted to hear instead of giving ME, the interviewed an opportunity to tell my history. The \"interview\" only lasted 20 minutes and out of that I probably only spoke for 2 minutes. The recruiter was rude, arrogant and when I asked a simple question about the requirement for that position he did not know the answer. Not to mention he never asked if I had any questions and did not care to make any connection with the person being interviewed.\n\nIf this guy reflects the mentality of Microsoft I will pass this opportunity and would probably not recommend others to apply.

He then went on to tell me he came down 15 minutes ago to meet with me, even though he set the time for us to meet (noon, not 11:45). Strike two.

Since I was interested in talking with him about the actual position, I opted for just coffee instead. Strike two and a half. When we sat down with our coffee, he proceeded to regale me with disparaging comments about industry experts, outdated tools and antiquated practices. Strike three.

A final series of on-site interviews was scheduled for the middle of December, but had to be moved earlier due to other offer deadlines I had. The on-site interviews involved meeting with four members of the same team, and each one had one or two technical exercises with whiteboard coding which had an initial solution and were then gradually improved, either by adding functionality or increasing performance. The next day, I got an email with positive feedback but was told that the team I interviewed with was already at capacity, so my recruiter would need to find a new team. After around a month of talking back and forth, we found a placement that worked and I received a final offer, which I accepted.\r\n\r\nI would give a thumbs up for the whole process but (1) it took really too long in my opinion and (2) it seems strange that I was interviewed by a team that wasn't actively hiring.",

There are 6 interviewers and the whole process is to last about 6 hours. \r\n\r\nThe first interview went long (was supposed to be 45 minutes scheduled but was actually 30), and the hiring manager for the position interrupted with a rude and sarcastic tone to his employee interviewing me to move on. There was something that came up, so the second person I was to interview with had a substitute from another department. The third interview was with the hiring manager and most of it was him talking about his accomplishments and \"how many irons he had in the fire\".  The fourth interview was with a gentleman that was nice but ultimately uninterested. The fifth interview was with a woman who would have been my direct supervisor and I felt we had a good conversation. The final interview did not happen as the gentleman that was supposed to interview me never showed. Very unprofessional. That would sum up the interview nicely; unprofessional. I took a PTO day to interview with an office that was obviously not taking the process as seriously as I was. My favorite part was at the end after I had sat in a room alone for 45 minutes, and the hiring manager came in and said we were done. I informed him that the final interviewer missed his appointment with me and he then lied to my face and said that today we just did the 5 instead of 6 interviews. \r\n\r\nAwesome. Anyhow, I got the feeling that I was an addition as a filler to round out the sixth position as I only had 2 days to make PTO arrangements. The day before I got an email that was supposed to be intended for the \"ringer\" as he was coming in from an office in Kansas to interview for the position. I should have contacted the Kansas HR manager to let him know I got an email that was clearly not intended for me that had him as my POC. I guess I know why one of the interviewers badmouthed the hired head hunter agency that Microsoft uses. \r\n\r\nI still can't believe how laughably bad the whole process was. Here I was thinking all along that a company like Microsoft had their stuff together. Man, I was either really wrong, or everyone I met was having their worst day in a long time. Even though I was never really in consideration, I learned a lot and am thankful for the experience and more importantly, the story.",

    "review": "I was part of the 2019 university hiring and the process was pretty interesting. It all began with the 1st round which was made up of a codility test and a Skype interview which I passed\ud83e\udd17.  The Skype was more of concept and design questions while the codility was to test your programming in which I coded 2 out of 3 problems very well.\r\nRound 2 was an on-site interview which involved mostly technical questions and white board coding and they were 4 in number each lasting 45 mins.\r\n\r\nThe on-site interview was more like a discussion with the interviewer.  One thing I did to make the interview process this way was that; given each question, I described it the way I saw it before the interviewer and tried explaining to him how i will solve it then tried to optimize my algorithm. Along my explanation, if I was going astray, he could easily bring me back on track either by asking me a question or literally telling me to think in some other direction using some type or data structure. \r\n\r\nBefore the interview, I was really nervous, but as i engaged in this talk with the interviewer, the fear just disappeared as he could  speak out to help me since he was listening to me and understanding what I was trying to do. \r\n\r\nI realized at the end that it doesn't pay you anything if you try to just jump into the coding and start writing code when given a question. You will end up getting stuck. You won't be given any credit if you  finish the interview in 5mims. Spend time and interact with your interviewer on the question. Talk to him and listen to him talk. This will also show him that you will do well in a team. Solving the question alone can show him that you are a bad team player. So even if you know the code to that problem, first discuss it with him. Explain the algorithm to him in plain words. At the end, i realized that this interview thing is just easy. This was my first ever interview immediately out of college and I nailed it \u263a\ufe0f",

You start off in a room with all the interview candidates for all the internship roles, and you get time to network with fellow interview candidates and a couple of full time employees. You then go through the 4 interviews in a row. Each interviewer was different, but most interviews were focused on behavioral questions. They asked a lot of questions about collaboration. I was also asked a lot about specific resume experiences. The marketing-related questions were fairly basic for the most part, but I did get some that threw me off. After the 4 interviews, you get treated to lunch and a brief campus tour, then you're free to go home. Microsoft pays for all your travel and gives you a generous budget for food, sightseeing, etc. Overall, the on-site interview experience was awesome!\r\n\r\nAdvice: read \"Rise Above the Noise\" by Lewis C. Lin. Read Microsoft's annual report and gain a deep understanding of their product line and where their products stand within the tech industry as a whole. Be educated on current events in the industry. Prepare a personal and unique answer for \"Why Microsoft?\" Start every marketing question by thinking about the consumer. Have examples prepared for every common behavioral question. Make sure your answers show that you align with Microsoft's culture and values. Emphasize teamwork and leadership abilities.

It was like 10 days before the interview day. On the interview day, I bused over an hour to the place. The interviewer was a software engineer manager. Without a self-introduction due to lack of time, he first tasked me to solve a coding question. Then, he asked me a behavioral question \"tell me a time when you encounter a big problem in the team, and how you solve it\".  It might be followed up with a design question, but it depended on the time left and the roles applied. The interviewer asked me a design question. but to be honest, i didn't answer it well. At last, he said we still have 3 to 5 minutes for me to ask some questions. Overall, the interview was a nice learning opportunity since it was my first interview in my dream companies.",

They asked a stupidly easy leetcode question where everybody who have studied beforehand would be able to get it in less than 5 minutes.  I waited for two months but they never got back to me to schedule my on-site interview.  I followed up with the recruiter multiple times and initially she said you will hear back in 1-3 weeks then it's 3-6 weeks. Honestly a waste of time. They treated you like second class citizen when you don't have a pending offer.\r\n \r\nAdvice to their recruiting team: if you want to use on-campus interview as a way to weed out people, maybe you should ask some slightly harder questions. Otherwise you can just fly everyone onsite and skip the on-campus interview. And you should also keep in mind that most people don't just apply to microsoft and a lot of companies offers expire in 1-2 weeks, which is not enough time to do an onsite and get the final decision.",

The interviews varied, and the interviewers went in ascending order of seniority at the company. First interview was talking about my background, a few problem solving questions, and a product design question. Second was talking through hypothetical questions of what I would do if I were a PM in certain situations, and then talking about what factors I would consider in product design/development/launch. Third was mostly background, behavioral questions, and again what factors I would consider in developing an app. Fourth was not really an interview, but more just a discussion about security concerns and some questions.

At one point, it felt as if the 2nd panel was humiliating me and the product that I was working on\n- On campus, I was told by the recruiter that I cleared the 2nd interview and each round was an elimination round. So, I waited 3 hours for the next interviewer (EM round)\n- After EM round, I was told by HR that they ll get back to me later as the hiring manager was not around\n- Next week, I was told that I didn't qualify the 2nd F2F interview round and they will get back once they have a consolidated feedback\n- Till now, HR has not bothered to get back or update status on Microsoft Portal. She kept saying that she doesn't have feedback of all interviewers.   After few days, she was unresponsive. \n\nIf you really respect a candidate's time, you would have the courtesy to atleast tell them about rejection.

    "review": "I applied all the way in September of 2021, and I also had a few connections at MSFT to write me a referral. This did help me get to the phone round. So please make sure you have a credible referral. Anyways the phone round was straightforward, except for the fact that my recruiter thought I was going for the SWE Intern role instead of the Explorer role. Luckily she picked up the fact that I was applying for Explore. \n\nPhone Round:\n\nThe phone round was pretty simple. It started with brief introductions and whatnot. We then jumped straight into the questions, which were straightforward behavioral questions and about how I started CS and why I am passionate. They also asked what my favorite MSFT product is and how would I change it.  Lastly, there were a few minutes left for questions and I just ask questions that show passion. Make sure you ask them the next steps and connect with them on LinkedIn so you can establish a means of communication. The email that they send you is also reply-able. \n\n2 weeks later I got the email saying I was moving onto the final round of interviews so now I started prepping by doing leetcodes, checking glassdoor for questions, and by reading \"Cracking the Coding Interview\" and \"60 Seconds and You're Hired\".  This was definitely overdoing it so do not feel overwhelmed. But remember you can never be overprepared so use your best judgment.\n\n\nFinal Round Interviews: There were 2 interviews so I will be giving details about both, also both had the same structure but keep in mind you could get any combination of technical questions or PM questions in the interview but only one question. So maybe 2 tech interviews or 1 tech interview and 1 PM interview. Also, the last few minutes are questions. Time also flies quickly but the interviews are 45 mins.\n\nRound 1: Asked behavioral questions and introductions. We jumped straight into resume-based questions so make sure you know how to talk about your resumes inside and out.  I was asked some concept-based questions about CS. That ate up all the time but I asked questions and got his LinkedIn\n\nRound 2: Same as the previous round, I had a technical question in this round it was equivalent to LC Easy. Make sure you know your strings and arrays inside out. I doubt they will ask you any hard data structures or algos apart from an arraylist which you should also know. \n\n2 Weeks later I got my offer after contacting my recruiter on the status on my application because the Action Center was stuck on \"interview scheduled\"\n\nOverall Summation:\n\nI know this was a read,z but I tried to give as many details as possible. Breathe you will be fine as long as you prepare. As long as you don't choke on any questions and explain your reasoning you should be fine. Show passion and make sure you smile. The Interviewers want you to be comfortable so you can hold a conversation. Be formal but be casual about it (if that makes sense). The interviews went great and the hardest part is waiting in general. Disclaimer: This was my experience and everyone has different experiences  I am not saying your interview will be the same therefore please take information on here as an individual anecdote.",

Recruiter asked what language I would prefer to interview in for the on-site, I stated python - this is important later.\r\n\r\nGet to the on-site and go for my first interview. I'm asked what language I want to program in. Caught off guard, I answer I requested Python. The interviewer stated he didn't know python but would be willing to learn from me in the interview. Finish their question and they ask how making the process multi-threaded would work. I explain the nuance of Python threading, explain it isn't like other languages and why then implement the change.\r\n\r\nSecond on-site. Same deal. Asked what language and I started seeing a problem at this point. The interviewer didn't know Python again. No big deal - we get through the problem, I explain the solution along the way, how I planned to solve it, and get valid code that compiles and does as it should. Then the interviewer takes a look and can't figure out how it works. I walk them through it, they still don't get it. A few more walkthroughs after and I realize they aren't getting that there's a variable being declared, modified, then sent back as the control for the loop. I explain that part more carefully, they say they think they got it but time ran out to confirm. On to the next one.\r\n\r\nGo to lunch, meet with the guy I tech screened with, no big deal. He has to go to a meeting so he drops me off at the lobby to wait for the next interview.\r\n\r\nThe interview is supposed to start at 2pm. 2pm comes along and nothing. Ok, no big deal, probably just caught up in a meeting. 2:05pm, still nothing. 2:10pm I go to the front desk and ask for them to be pinged. 2:15pm, still no one. 2:20pm they finally show up. We go to the room and they start the basic questions. \"What's your experience?\", \"Why are you leaving your other company?\", etc. After this, they give me a question and I start talking it through, writing up things to keep track of on the white-board. I turn around and they are answering emails on their computer, not paying attention at all. Get to the end of the problem and I walk through some test cases.\r\nInterviewer: \"How does this work without a global variable?\"\r\nMe: \"There's a return statement, right here...\"\r\nI: \"That doesn't matter. How does it get the data from the other parts without a global?\"\r\nMe: \"It's a recursive function - the retur-\"\r\nI: \"No. This won't work without a global.\"\r\nMe: \"It doesn't need a global, the return statement passes the data ba-\"\r\nI: \"Sorry, times up. Let's get you to the next interview.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth interview I cannot complain about - the person knew Python well enough to read my code and we got along great. They were attentive and respectful the entire time. More questions about general concepts for network develoupment and the likes.\r\n\r\nDon't even leave the hotel and I get the news that they are not hiring.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I was bummed out but didn't think to make a post about it here. Then today, over a week after the interviews, my recruiter reached out and asked how it went. Over a week after I was told I wasn't getting the position. \r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nClosing notes: Disorganised interview process, lack of communication between the recruiters/hiring committee/interviewers, and lack of interest from the interviewers.",

I am sharing my Microsoft interview experience, this is the 2nd time I gave the final rounds of Microsoft, the 1st time it was very smooth and the interviewers were amazing, but this time around I can't say the same for one of the interviewers\r\n\r\n2nd round\r\n\r\n1st interview\r\nThere were 2 questions asked and both were easy and I produced a working solution.\r\n\r\n2nd interview\r\nI have given tons of interviews before and this one would rank on the top of the WORST ones for me, both in terms of performance and interviewer.\r\nThe question asked was easy to understand and I could have solved it using a different method which was clear to me, but the interviewer was adamant on using his data-structure which I was not able to comprehend. It took a lot of back and forth discussing the pros and cons of using his vs mine. Around 20 minutes of the time was wasted on this discussion and I was left with another 25 minutes. The interviewer then let me proceed with my solution but stopped me again mid-way to use his again. It was both distracting as well as difficult since it broke the chain of thoughts.\r\nAlthough the interviewer has worked in the company for a long time, I respect that, but that interview style was completely unacceptable, I have always dreamt of working for Microsoft one day and it has been my childhood dream, but this experience was very disappointing and I question myself about it.\r\n\r\n  3rd interview\r\nTwo questions were asked and both were again on the medium spectrum of difficulty, got some good feedbacks from the interviewer and got a working solution for both the problems. \r\n\r\n4th interview.\r\nBasic OOPS questions and again a coding question which was on the easy level of difficulty. I produced a working solution for this one too in the last minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterviewer number 1,3 & 4 were very pleasant to work with and that's how I have felt giving interviews for other companies as well.\r\nOverall I could produce a working solution for 5/6 questions and still got rejected. I will definitely take this as a learning experience and move forward to join another company.",

Clearly don't value the time of a professional, from where he is coming on a Sunday eve and in what circumstances. Clearly indicates how well you treat your prospective employees and how much concerned you are with their careers.",

Its better to get a referral to increase the chance of getting the interview. \r\n\r\n45 mins Initial phone screen with the recruiter -  checking my background and understanding the interest and relevancy to the role, salary expectations, other offers at hand.  Since I already had an offer at hand, and going to two other onsites the same week the recruiter said she will expedite the process at Microsoft. The same week 30 minutes phone call with the hiring manager was scheduled. During this time hiring manager asked me details about the programs I worked on, double clicking on KPIs and asking more questions on how I measured those. Also asked questions about the technical skills I highlighted on my resume (kubernetes, Docker, AWS). I heard after 2 days about the onsite and it was scheduled the following week. During Onsite I had 6 rounds and I only knew about the first person I will meet with, even that kept changing until the last minute. \r\n\r\nThe interview started with meeting a principal PM who digged into my PM skills (Collaboration, Prioritization, Resolving conflicts etc), then next round was with another PM and it was more of a culture fit round Why microsoft, why that role, what innovations I have done, my motivations, best job I had. After this there was few minutes break and then I met with a Dev manger and after some initial background and requirements questions I was asked feature design question to increase user base for Bing Search. After this I met with a senior dev who went straight into feature design and data modeling. It was a full white board round and I did get stuck towards the end but I openly asked the interviewer to help me which he did and I was able to pick up and continue with the exercise.  Then I met with the hiring manager who again was diving deeper into my background and the kinds of programs I managed. The last was the AsApp interview with a senior dev manager who started with team collaboration questions and then did another feature exercise session on Cortana.  \r\n\r\nOverall it was a great experience and my advice for anyone going to interview at Microsoft would be to enjoy the interview process and be honest/real.",

Had a phone conversation with the Recruiter the very next day and then an \u201cInformational\u201d (conference call) with a member of the Customer Success team that same day. The Informational was great and gave details about the position, the clients, and the team. I was asked to do an all-day interview via MS Teams (w/ video!) about 2.5 weeks later. Since the position would be remote and those who interviewed me (4 people, 1:1 style) were spread out amongst the East and West Coasts, there were no in-person interviews. The interview process was easy to me however, I have been on A LOT of interviews so my views may be different. Each interviewer was interested to know any stories or examples of what I\u2019ve done throughout my career. Each interview was 30 minutes to one hour long. Even though I did not get a job offer, I appreciate that the Recruiter called me on the phone (less than 1 week after the interviews) to tell me I did not get the job. Can you believe this in 2019?! Still impressed and shocked by this. In my 20-year career, I have NEVER had a Recruiter do this. His feedback was that everyone gave me glowing reviews but that they ultimately chose someone that may have ticked more boxes than I did. In the end, although I was disappointed, I feel that there is a reason for everything. Sometimes the position that you feel is the right fit for you may not be at all. Great company and I was so honored to have even been selected to interview as I know they receive hundreds of resumes every single day! One key piece of advice, is to have a thorough LinkedIn profile. At least 3 of the 4 people that interviewed me had my LinkedIn profile up DURING the interview and dove deeper into my experience. Having an effective LI profile seems to be hugely important these days...",

The team mostly consisted of asian people and most of them treated me well. I bottled the first round - The interviewer went on for like 20-25 minutes explaining me about his team structure and how it fits into the business model etc. It was good to learn that but then it took away a lot of my time from the time allotted for the coding question ! Should I have stopped in between? I don't know but it backfired heavily since I couldn't finish the problem successfully. The second one went on well, the only round where I had a productive discussion and was pretty confident that I had done well enough. The third one was a simple coding question but with a lot of follow-up questions like how would you make the code work for any data type, edge cases and all that. The lunch interview was with the same one and he asked me a bunch of scenario based Qs and good practices in sw engg. The last one was pleasant to work with, really enjoyed talking to him and then I was done. \r\n\r\nOverall I had a good set of challenges but as always I was not at my best or probably needed a better version of myself !

He asked me to cut-short the introduction and asked for any best bug I have solved yet. I explained to him the problem and then started giving him the strategy (in brief) which I used but seemed like he wants to cut-short that too. \r\nThe person really made me nervous because till now he was just looking at his laptop for most of the time and hardly looked to my face for 3-4 seconds. \r\n\r\nHe asked me to solve two very basic DS questions and before I could ask for any edge cases and range of numbers, he left the room and said to complete it within 5 min. I had 3-4 doubts but didn't get a chance to even ask it. \r\nAfter he came back, I was explaining him the first question approach he was again in a hurry due to his flight that he didn't even listen properly and made the judgment that I am very poor in DS. I never expected the interview to happen in such a way as I heard this 3 times in 30 min that he is getting late for the flight. \r\n\r\nNever expected this behavior from such a respected organization and in next 2 min. I was told in a very informal way by interview manager that based on the feedback you are rejected. Nothing like \"How was the interview and interviewer, are you having any doubts or anything, etc. \r\n\r\nI never got such a cold behavior from Microsoft before and if time is the issue I believe it's not the mistake of a candidate to keep him waiting for 3 hours and then just send him in 25 min. interview.

I had a call with the recruiter, followed by a 45 minute interview with the hiring manager on Microsoft Teams. For this interview, I had to prepare a Pre-Sales Role Play based on a potential prospect for Microsoft Azure. I had to also prepare a few slides with some more information on and present this in 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nIn the remainder of the interview, we spoke about my motivation to join the company, my background experience, why I'd like to work for Microsoft and a lot of behavioural questions, as can be expected.  The interview went well, and a little under a week after this, I was invited to meet the team on-site in an informal setting. \r\n\r\nAt the on-site meeting, I was asked some questions again, but it was in a casual environment and I got shown around the offices and met the team as well and I got to know more about the role and ask questions. A few days later, I got a call by the recruiter that I was offered the position and I accepted it.\r\n\r\nOverall, the process took around 2-3 weeks in total for this role and I found it to be quite straight forward. The recruiters were great at communicating and keeping me updated in the process. \r\nThe only downside was that I had to travel many hours by public transport to meet the team on-site, despite I was told the interview with the manager would be the last one.

The day started off with an introduction to ourselves, we then had a speed dating/networking session with the hiring managers who would be choosing which candidate they'd like to hire and they gave us an insight into their department and what they do. We then, got to meet the other Interns there who gave us an insight into what life is like as an Intern for Microsoft which was really useful. We then had an individual assessment with a hiring manager, in which I was given 15 mins to do my preparation and 5 mins to talk with 5 mins for questions as well. The second assessment was in groups and we were given 20 mins to prepare and 10 mins to present to a panel of the hiring managers. The afternoon session consisted of a tour of the Head Office and then 2x 1-to-1 interviews with 2 different hiring managers which lasted 30 mins each; the questions consisted of scenario-based questions and then they asked other questions in order to get to know me better. They also allowed me to ask questions myself and gave very detailed answers. \r\n\r\nWe were told that we'd hear back whether we're successful or not within 7-14 days.

Could sense they are all very knowledgeable and pretty senior.\r\n\r\nEach of them was very courteous and took good amount of time analyzing my expertise on the specific area they were interviewing on.\r\n\r\nFirst round was problem solving and the interviewer, a senior engineer, was very specific on the code written, the edge cases, the readability, and extensibility of the code. Would check how I would extend the code for a more generic problem. Some brushing up on design patterns would help here. Took around 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nSecond round was a mix of low level design, data structures and algorithms, and high level design. Interviewer was a mid level engineer, very friendly, and this round went more or less like a friendly discussion. Ended with a datastructure problem, where I was asked to write code on paper. Took about 1 hr.\r\n\r\nThird round was mostly high level design. Took by an ex googler and principal engineer here, too brilliant! Dug very deep into the intricacies of designing the system for the given problem. This round actually sealed it for me that I need to join this team. took around 1 hr.\r\n\r\nFourth and final round was probably with the hiring manager.

    "review": "The interview was at Swiftkey, which since acquisition is Microsoft Swiftkey. So I guess this review makes sense here, since the hiring process and decision is also completely made by Microsoft. At first, I thought this was some April fool's joke when I received the rejection email from Microsoft Swiftkey, not because I was expecting a positive reply, because how much my words were twisted in the last round of the interview and then were stated as a reason for rejection. The reason was that I had stated that in future I wanted to become a System/Solutions Architect , and as per Microsoft and that is something that sales people do, not people who have worked as Devops Engineers in the past. Also, because \"Gluing/Using existing tools together with automation, to help Developers deliver solutions faster and better, \" is probably not something that Devops Engineers do. I might have got the definition wrong.\r\n About the process, 6 Rounds in total. First a phone call with HR, second a telephonic interview with Hiring Manager, then 4 rounds of face to face interviews on-site on the same day, 3 of which would be technical. The idea that would be sold to you by HR will be that they conduct 4 rounds with 4 different interviewers so that Microsoft can receive an independent, unbiased opinion from all the interviewers, you may perform well in two and not so well in two and that wouldnt impact the outcome that much, if you did really really well in 2 rounds.  HOWEVER, in reality that is far far from truth.  The outcome would be only dependant upon how you perform in the last round, the one with someone from senior management (so keep an eye on the titles), whose main intention will be to make sure that you dont \"leak\" into Microsoft from Swiftkey somehow.  The senior management person will be interested in all your previous role, most importantly why you left em, would try to question you in various ways just to find out if you are lying or not.  Besides this, the other three rounds will be purely technical white board algorithm questions, if you have interviewed for Developer roles after uni in the past you would be better off. Typical questions from books like '100 coding questions to crack and whiteboard interviews'. There will be no systems/architecture based questions, bacause they are looking for a Developer, not a Devops Engineer, its just a badly advertised/described role. I didnt know about any of this when I showed up for the interview, so I hope this helps out atleast a few folks out there",

The 60 minute online test which I took was stressed to be 3 questions, but instead had 5. The first three were all of the same question form (what is wrong with this code and fix it), but in different languages. It was clear to me these were standins for eachother, and you could choose which one to solve, as the test was only to be 3 questions in 60 minutes, not 5 questions. It would be absurd to have to finish all three of these (c++,typescript,react), especially as the test was also stressed to be language agnostic. Why am I even forced to a language type for these questions in the first place if the exam is language agnostic?\r\n\r\nIn addition, the test did not actually state that one did or did not have to complete all 3 of these quasi-duplicates, which means I had no way to tell whether this was a poorly stated 3 question exam, or a terribly constructed 5 question exam with an absurd timelimit. I was told I did not answer some questions, of which I did not answer the duplicates of course, and was not passed. Did the person grading it not know it was a 3 question exam? How is that even possible, unless the person was not informed on how to grade the exam properly? Do the people collectively managing this hiring process communicate together about the process itself? On communicating all of these concerns, I have received no feedback, and the recruiter has seemingly ceased communications. How ironic.\r\n\r\nRed. Flags.\r\n\r\nSo many red flags.\r\n\r\nThis is a major failure on their part, and I cannot support or take part in this process, so I will not be re-applying to Microsoft for any position.\r\n\r\n**And in addition to all these issues, the recruiter invited me to an event previously, which I prepared for... but since she invited me to a second event as well, the initial invitation was no longer on the table, which I was not ever informed of. It turns out there is a process of technical screening beforehand, which I was never informed or updated about. So I scheduled for a day at their campus, and that was a bit poor on their part, too.",

All three of us were placed in rooms down the same hall side by side. \n\nEach interview lasted 45 minutes. Hard to know what to expect with four completely different interviewing styles since obviously four individual managers. Really felt like the first person asked deep probing questions which really got me excited that I was able to describe myself and my experience very well. Second person was much harder to get that rapport going. Person was rather closed off, so much so I figure I was not favored at all. Struggled through second one. Had a 15 min break still in that same room. Third person also closed off. Didn\u2019t ask many probing questions at all. Didn\u2019t really dive into my experience was almost like I was filling a quota for number of candidates. Last interview and not going to lie at this point I am fried. Also pretty much know I will not be shortlisted. Fourth person was great.

    "review": "Nicely organized, but poorly executed. \r\n\r\nSo my story started back in July last year. Saw this job on Microsoft careers site and applied. I was qualified enough to get a call and was confident about the interview. But I dint heard anything for a month. One day I was checking my SPAM emails and I found an email from Microsoft recruiter asking for details. This email was 3 weeks old so I immediately replied and also mentioned that somehow the recruiter's email went to my SPAM. Received a reply back that they are already interviewing and would not accept any more candidates at this time. REALLY? you just sent 1 email and never followed up. No call or follow up email. This is how you recruit talent? Great recruiters you have, Microsoft!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I asked recruiter to consider me for a suitable role and she replied that she will call back once another role opens up. However, with my experience, I dint relied on the recruiter and kept an eye on the careers portal. Fortunately, I found a similar role opened up after 4 months. This time, I applied and sent an email to the same recruiter. She passed my resume to HM and as expected, I received a phone interview request.  \r\n\r\nPhone interview - Super easy. Basic skill related questions. received a call back from recruiter that Microsoft would like to invite me for onsite interview. \r\n\r\nOnsite interview - Microsoft booked hotel, rental car and flight. Flew to Redmond a night before. Picked up my rental car and drove to Redmond Marriott. The give $75 for meals. So, had my dinner and slept early for a refreshing start next day. \r\n\r\nInterview day - reached MS building and waited in lobby for the first interviewer. He came to to the lobby and escorted me to the interview room. \r\nFirst interview - Background and skill related questions. With the type of questions he was asking, I became sure that he has no background in modernization and has just started picking up the pace. Hence, at the end of interview, I asked him when did he joined and the reply was just as I expected - 4 months back :). Anyways, the interview went OK. \r\nSecond interview - This was the interview that made me think - 'Am I really interviewing for Microsoft or for a contractual job at a consulting company??' This person recently started learning things and was asking questions as he is an expert. I had no idea what he was talking about. He even dint knew the industry terms for migration, kubernetes, CI/CD, and was just asking irrelevant questions. Then he started asking developer questions from an architect REALLY? Out of those questions, some were logically incorrect, but I refrained from arguing as I was on the other side. I confirmed my inference the next day when I googled them. Due to NDA, I cannot disclose questions.\r\nThird interview - the ONLY one which made me feel as I was interviewing with Microsoft.  Started with lunch and stretched to 2 hours. Nice interesting conversation with a group PM. Knowledgeable and interesting gentleman. He confirmed that the first two guys joined MS without any background and are still learning things. \r\nFourth interview - the HM - 45 mins, with 30 mins questions and 15 mins for me. Initially, I thought that he is asking good questions. I started with explaining an approach which we 'actually' implemented at my work place. But then he interrupted! and started giving his own hypothetical solutions.  The solutions that he gave are good on papers, but when we actually implement (ask me as I have been there and done that), cause a lot of issues.  \r\n\r\nAfter this experience, I was shocked as I expected better from Microsoft as I received from amazon recently. I strongly opposed using MS azure as a preferred partner for my company's modernization plan after this experience. Glad we ended up contracting AWS :)",

First was an introductory call simple non-technical just to verify I have the experience they are looking for.\r\n\r\nSecond call was the a programming interview with one of the senior engineer (not the hiring manger), We discussed about the role and experience. He asked me to write simple C related programs on shared screen. Not very tough. Correct definitions type questions.\r\n\r\nThird, interview was onsite with 4 team members, 3 interviews were 30 minutes long with one lunch interview of which was 30 mins lunch + 30 minutes interview. First 2 interviews were technical in nature focused on C programming, RTOS and communication protocols. Few questions related to source control. 3rd interview was 50% technical + 50% behavioral. (how do you work in team environments). After every interview your current interviewer tells the next one about your strength and weaknesses and also whether you are a 'HIRE' or 'NO HIRE'., based on which the next interviewer tailors his questions to test your strengths. Good thing is Microsoft wants to hire people for there strengths, and they wring you out on that so you better be good and confident. After 3 interviews (most of the times 4 ) if you get majority of 'HIRES' then they discuss whether or not to send you to the next level. Which is mostly with a senior level manager while you wait in the lobby. (which I found it extremely weird and insulting.) If there decision is in your favor then you get interviewed by the last interviewer. I got the last interview which was again 30% technical (just to test how you approach a problem), and 70% non-technical behavioral to see understand whether you will be a good fit for Microsoft's culture. \r\n\r\nOverall, timeline wise, extremely sluggish process. It took around 5 months from the first interview to get the offer and another 1+ month to perform background check and get the joining date. It took 2+ weeks for recruiter to tell me that I was selected, another 3 weeks to  get the offer. Another 1+ months for background check and finally the joining date.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have meditated your whole life and want to test your patience apply here. I wasn't actively looking so it kind of didn't really matter to me.\r\n\r\nThey really need to improve and be more agile in the recruitment process that could be another reason why they are loosing their employees to Amazon. Amazon has a policy to give feedback within 48 hours. And interview process takes around 3-4 weeks of time which is average and acceptable.",

LOL\nThen with second interviewer initially i said i have no experience on spectrum analyzer, i have experience on VNA, oscilloscope, multimeter etc. \nBut it seems like she had a set of questions on spectrum analyzer, and she was reading continuously one after another question on spectrum analyzer lol.\nWhy would keep asking question on something which was already told by candidate that he has no experience on.\n\nOverall, I had higher expectations from Microsoft, but it turned out to be that everything is robotic there, I think employee should be trained on moral and ethical behavior and a matured professional should conduct the interview.",

On the day of the interview she arrives 12 MINUTES late to a 30 minute \u201cscreening interview\u201dwithout explanation or acknowledgement!! Or apology. When I experienced audio issues for a few minutes trying to use Teams on a Mac (psst sorry MS but Zoom is so much better) she grew impatient even though I said nothing of her arriving so late. I should note I arrived 10 mins early - had she been on time or even slightly early to account for connection, we would\u2019ve had more time and and her  composure over the issues. Also connectivity issues happen all the time. It\u2019s technology not perfection. You\u2019d think MS would know that. Nonetheless we managed to get thru her questions but when I asked the basics such as comp package to determine whether they could afford me she shakes her head saying she\u2019s not going to have that discussion bc that\u2019s an HR issue and would come up \u201clater\u201d. Later? I\u2019m thinking why on earth am I having my first screening interview w a person who can\u2019t even tell me how much this pays and why on earth would I give them a full day\u2019s worth of interviews which was expected in the next round according to her  (at the busiest time of the year for a contract manager) without even knowing a range at least? The process was so disorganized and made no sense to me at all. As colleagues have pointed out - if this is how she manages an interview process then how is she managing the team?! I sent a post call email nonetheless, acknowledging the meeting starting late yet nonetheless thanking her for her patience and one question I had neglected to ask. No reply. Hey SE, I was interviewing you as much as you were interviewing me. You seemed to forget that. Arriving on time to your meetings is fundamental professionalism. I expected better out of MS. And MS or not, there are plenty of other and better options out there for those of us qualified candidates for which I hear there\u2019s a shortage in the filed right now. Good luck!",

There were four rounds, and each had focus on technical skills. Each round lasted for about an hour or more. All interviews on the same day. They ask you technical problems to which you need to explain a solution and then write code using pen and paper. The interviewer helps you through the thought process, but make sure you talk clearly and don't rush to find an answer. They'll give you ample time. Usually one interview (an hour) is spent discussing just one (or maximum two) problem. \n\nThey generally hire for Microsoft and not specifically for a position, so there is no specific expectation that you must know a particular technology. But in general your software concepts should be straight - DS, Algorithms, Coding skills, OOP concepts, and at least one programming language of your choice.\n\nClarity of thought and approach to problem are key. Then comes the coding part - write clean code, or take a separate page for scratch work, but in the end submit code which is bug free and looks clean. You may not solve all corner cases initially, and that's okay. But think of as many cases as possible and tell the interviewer what you have handled and what is left out. Overall, be clear in communication. \n\nThey also ask some standard questions like why Microsoft, what hard problems you have solved in the past, etc.\n\nOnce you are selected, their recruitment team takes over the process, and the onboarding is pretty smooth with lots of upfront communication and emails, etc. They help you relocate, and are flexible with your date of joining etc. Compensation is pretty good too.",

The most difficult part of the interview process is getting communication from the recruiters, especially contractors (aka \"v-dash\" recruiters). They will reach out and then ghost you, not respond to emails, phone calls, LinkedIn messages, texts. You'll be left in the dark for weeks. I received a verbal offer that dematerialized when the recruiter blamed the team for not actually having the budget to hire for the position. They flew me out to Bellevue for nothing.",

The interview was for a new graduate after MS degree, it was composed of a face to face with a college recruiter and after that an onsite interview in Seattle.\r\nThe onsite went very well and after about a month I got an email for getting to the next stage and coming to an onsite. Everything was scheduled and 3 days of my time was dedicated to this task (excluding the preparation and traveling 6 hours each way from NY to Seattle). No one has contacted me while in Seattle or after coming back home. After multiple emails and phone calls on my end, I've got an email saying there was an error and we should reschedule. No one has contacted me afterward even after replying to those emails. I had interviews with all of the major tech companies including Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, been to many onsite interviews but I have never experienced this weird treatment. I believe it was a communication problem but to me, it felt like a big waste of my time and I wouldn't wish anyone to pass the experience I had. Do yourself a favor and find a company who cares, luckily I got to a much better company who values me and my time.",

I informed the recruiter regarding that and she said that the interviewers can change things up how they like , and it\u2019s not in her hands. I then had a follow up interview with another manager which was more of compliance interview (motivation to join Microsoft etc.) I then had some time to ask the manager a few questions. Lots of my questions were answered in an uncertain tone and never got a straight answer, as if the manager didn\u2019t know or wasnt sure. The questions that I asked where mostly how performance is assessed, how goals are set , if there is training provided, what opportunities for career development are there. Most of the answers I got where that some teams do it, and that it depends on the team manager etc. No clear and no straight answers. The manager made it clear that there is NO TRAINING PROVIDED, and that there are a lot of knowledge base articles and videos to gather information and that colleagues will help out. I\u2019ve read all the other reviews on here for that position and almost all the reviews are very bad. I felt a lot of uncertainty in there.

Scheduled an onsite for late November (they were hella busy and asked me to wait for January but I had deadlines) . \n\nOnsite was very nice. 4 rounds - 45 mins each. Pretty easy questions. No gotcha or some black magic algorithms prior knowledge. The interviewers were amazingly human compared to the other big four I\u2019ve interviewed for. Humble and incredibly happy individuals. (Note that you have to do 2 rounds min, but you need 4 - 5 rounds to be fully considered. They did cut people off early) \n\nThe whole onsite package was amazing. Free food, Microsoft jacket. Paid everything!",

Interviewed by recruiter and told him that CA was not my first choice so the Recruiter added an Austin TX position to my \"Action Center\" profile.    Was contacted and went through a second interview for technical, I was truthful and stated I was an AWS architect with some small experience and comparative knowledge on Azure.  \r\n\r\nInterview was from a guy whose AWS questions I explained throughly and to his satisfaction, at least that was how the interview seemed to track.  He explained that the position would be a cattle call to a city where 3 teams would spend about 2 hours with me and other candidates.  I should be prepared to propose a solution if I were called for that 3rd interview. \r\n\r\nNever heard back from them after this until 2 weeks later when someone at Microsoft added a Chicago posting to to my \"Action Center\" area.  The next week I was informed that I had not been selected for the Austin position via a form letter and the position was removed from my \"Action Center\" board.\r\n\r\nI then received an inquiry from another MS recruiter, this time a woman.  She wanted to know if I was interested in the Irvine position, again.  i was patient, answered her back and received  another questionnaire, a little more detailed than the first one.  The questions are not bad, and were good practice so I answered in greater detail .  I explained where I had been in the process and share that I might not be someone she should consider.  We scheduled a meeting via email.\r\n\r\nWhen we had the email, I carefully explained what had happened and after looking at her MS recruiting system, she informed me with apologies that there had been some confusion and that if I didn't hear from her in a week then contact her and she would get back to me.\r\n\r\nIt's been over a week and I'm not going to contact her of the original recruiter.  Obviously MS has some issues when recruiting for positions.  These firms are 3rd party contractors hired by MS to hire for them.  More than a little unorganized and although I was happy to be considered, I was a little disappointed in the communication, if not the lack of results.",

Small chat to know what I want to do, everything was fine.\r\n\r\n- Take home quiz, just to be sure that you know the basics. Does not matter that you complete all of it, but try anyway. Try to do it by yourself, copy-pasting from somewhere won't help during the next phone session.\r\n\r\n- If you did good, you will receive a call from one of their managers to assess your skills. Given the nature of Havok product, we went over literally everything from 3d graphics to physics to coding. Does not matter that you know everything, but you should be able to cover as much topics as possible.\r\n\r\n- On-site interview in Dublin, split in two sessions:\r\n---- live coding test, you're left alone with a simple exercise, with no pressure at all (aside from reasonable time restrictions). This is a real coding test, it has nothing to do with memorizing code or lengthy complex algorithms that you will never use in real-life, you cannot cheat your way through this. If you have real experience, it's extremely easy, otherwise is impossible, no matter how many corner cases of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, binary search and whatever you memorized, it's a coding test for real coders.\r\n---- present something you did and you're proud off, you're free to talk about whatever you want, as long as is something interesting. Usually they will listen carefully to what you present and ask questions.\r\n\r\nThen a final chat with the managers so they get a better idea of you.\r\n\r\nReceived a very, very good offer without even negotiating, which unfortunately I had to decline because I received another one as good and it did not require relocation (housing in Dublin is insane).\r\n\r\nOverall very pleasant experience. Everyone was friendly and I really had a great impression from the team. \r\n\r\nThis is how job interviews should be conducted. Please stop the insanity of phone-live coding session with shared screens, or whiteboard coding, it's useless and it only asserts that someone can open several tabs and copy-paste from them or memorize thousands of lines of code.",

Basically pamper you.\r\n\r\nInterview is 3 interviews.\r\n\r\nFreshman year it was PM, PM, Tech.\r\nSophomore year it was Tech, PM, Tech.\r\n\r\nFreshman year I did badly on all 3 and was very incoherent. Got a Dynamic Programming question for my Technical interview and blew up. Then proceeded to mess up simple Object Oriented design.\r\n\r\nSophomore year I did excellent on the first Technical interview (it was very straightforward). Then I got cocky and had a weak PM interview. The final interview I was asked to reverse a singly linked list and doubly linked list. Thought I had it in the bag and my arrogance probably got through to my interviewer who was a quiet person and looked at me with a subliminal message of resentment.\r\n\r\nThe interviews are generally easy.

These interviews were for an entry-level university full-time position for the Oslo office in Norway. \r\n\r\nThe phone interview was straight-forward, with a palindrome programming question, followed by some questions of general computer science topics (complexity, memory, etc.) in addition to some specific questions regarding my area of expertise.\r\n\r\nWithin a couple of days, I received an email with the details on how to book a flight to their office for an on-site interview.\r\n\r\nThe on-site interview was a little bit more thorough; each candidate underwent 3-4 interviews in a row, rotating interviewers every 45 minutes with a 5-minute break in between. Each interviewer started by asking some general, open-ended questions - not necessarily relating to programming. They told me that the interview process had recently been changed across Microsoft and that these open-ended questions were asked to gauge how the candidates think. The first two interviewers then asked some programming related questions (write a linked list in C, how does memory and resource management differ from C and garbage collected languages,) along with some discussion. Note that we were asked to program on a white board. The third interview asked a different and unexpected question about building a library (not the programming variant) that can support millions of users; what factors should you consider when building such a library (e.g. how to organize the books, how tall should the shelfs be, etc)? Note also that each interview ended by asking if I had any questions, so it would be wise not to ask every question to the first interviewer.",

    "review": "I got scheduled for a phone call with the hiring manager, which I expected to be technical, but was mostly a useless chat with no skill assessment and a vague description of the job. I still felt (and still believe) however I was a very good fit for the job as far as I could tell.\r\n\r\nSoon after the call on Friday I received a ridiculous homework assignment on a doc attachment that was supposed to be completed in about 1-2 hours and uploaded on Azure. Now, apart from the fact that offline assignments are unfair (because there is no interactive conversation) and unethical (because my time has value too), that weekend my baby, my wife and I got sick with high fever, the washing machine broke down and a bunch of other problems. So I ended up reading the email on Sunday late night, to find out that the deadline was the following day, which is not acceptable. I stupidly tried to do it anyway, despite everything, and realized that it's impossible to complete it in 2 hours, which was already more than I could afford spending. Because there is no way you can spend time designing the model and the API, write all the tests for 300/400 lines of code (TDD without finishing? Or get some design and no tests?), upload it and verify it's working in this little time. Also because if you are new to Azure you have to create an account (and/or try to retrieve a Microsoft one which failed and took me ages), spend at least 20 mins with all the forms where you have to fill in, BTW including you credit/debit card details. Yes you have to, because they do not offer a time limited throwaway account for this purpose! You have to use your \"free\" one time subscription credit (I consumed a third, 60 Eur) you cannot use for anything else then. And still have your card there and remember to unsubscribe at some point before you start to pay out of your pocket. Did they link any guide or resource on how to create an account in the email? No, you have to search yourself, spend another 30 mins at least looking for their documentation which is outdated because the interface changed meanwhile, so again more time, to understand how to enable the repo to push the code to, how to debug because chances are that the first time it's not going to work. And you end up spending 2 hours for irrelevant stuff that has nothing to do with skill assessment which could be easily and more accurately be done by phone or F2F in 30/45 minutes with no risk of cheating. What they probably wanted to verify is that you are willing to trash your weekends: well, no, I very much prefer to spend them looking for other employers the next time, thank you.\r\nOn top of this I didn't hear back until after 3-4 weeks later, when I received their automatic message that I have been rejected as they closed the position. They don't even bother write to you directly. Quite frankly, I'm not sure I want to work with and for such people anyway. Lack of professionalism in every single step and detail. The test itself may sound cool and smart to them, but it's actually disrespectful and pointless since doesn't test any real engineering or coding skill; anybody with a little bit of experience could successfully do it. And even if you don't have a clue on how to do it there is plenty of guides online,  or have a friend do it for you.\r\n\r\nBottom line: the whole process is amateurish, the lack of respect for the candidate annoying, probably the worst interview experience of my life.",

Its a mix of technical and resume based given that I have around work experience. I was honest in every response I gave. The interviewer was really nice and it was more conversational. \r\n\r\nI didn't expect an invite for an on-site interview. Since I made it to this level, I wanted to clear it. I had around 20 days when I got the invite for the onsite interviews. Read \"Cracking the PM interview\" and \"Decode and Conquer\". Practiced some behavioral and basic programming questions. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft took care of all the expenses to attend the interview onsite. \r\n\r\nOn the day of my interview, I meet four people.  I had to meet the hiring manager first since she couldn't accommodate in a different time. It was purely behavioral. I thought I screwed it since she gave me feedback which implied \"can do well and don't be nervous\"  at the end of my interview. \r\n\r\nMy 2nd interviewer did ask me a few design specific questions and some questions based out of my resume. I did better than my previous interview.\r\n\r\nThe third interview is the one I nailed. All questions were situation based like how I would handle a specific task or conflict. My experience as a Developer and Analyst helped me to answer these questions well. I asked a lot of questions in this round. By the end of this interview, I felt super comfortable and confident because my interviewer was really nice.\r\n\r\nI then had my final lunch interview. Though I was hungry by this time, I decided to go lite and simple so that I could concentrate more on talking than on eating. This interview was much more casual than all of my interviews. It was very conversational but at the same time, we managed to take turns in asking role specific questions. The trick I used to do well in this round is that I asked the questions I was asked by my interviewers in my previous rounds and I guess it worked since I cleared the interview ;)\r\n\r\nSince I only had 4 rounds as opposed to 5, I wasn't entirely positive.  (many successful PM interviews in glassdoor had 5 rounds with an \"as is\" round but not all. It looks like my lunch interview is my as is round).  \r\n\r\nWithin a week, I received an email saying I was a offered the job. \r\n\r\nTakeaways - \r\n* I have non-CS bachelors and Masters degree so my experience as a developer and analyst played a major role here. \r\n*If you have a degree in CS, you can expect some lite coding exercise.  \r\n*Make sure you know everything you mentioned in your resume. If they point out something and you are not an expert or don't have an explanation for it, be honest and justify it. \r\n* Focus on STAR based questions and have some readymade answers. Read/practice them well. These were the lifesavers in my case since I come from a non-CS educational background. \r\n* Read \"Cracking the PM interview\" and \"Decode and Conquer\". You may or may not get questions from this book but it helps a ton to read these books. Tailor your answers based on how these books recommend. \r\n* Don't forget to put a smile throughout the interview process. Interviewers at Microsoft are very friendly and you will definitely enjoy talking to them.\r\n*They don't expect you to dress professionally but doing so would definitely imply that you are serious about this job.\r\n* Most importantly, make sure to have your breakfast before the interview. I was only offered beverages during my first three rounds and each interview lasts for around an hour roughly. I'm glad I managed to eat that leftover pizza before leaving for the interview. Skipping the breakfast will only ruin your day so try to squeeze in some time to have an energy bar or anything for that matter.",

I had applied for this job online and received a call from the recruiter in a couple of weeks. \r\n\r\nThe 1st round was a Skype interview scheduled for an hour. The interviewer was very cordial and wanted me to succeed throughout the call. It was a conversation rather than an \"I ask, You Answer\" approach. This was in-fact true across all rounds. The 2nd round was a Skype interview as well with a business leader. It was for 30 minutes but I gained a lot of insights on how the company worked.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd round was a day long case study round with presentations and deliverables at end of it. It happened at the office premises. It was almost like a pre-cursor to \"a day in your life should you join\". I throughly enjoyed the approach even though it was intensive and very demanding with tight deadlines.\r\n\r\nThe 4th round was a face to face interview with a senior leader. It went for an hour. It was a conversation about my experience, technical, behavioural and leadership skills. I got a sense of how the interviewer wanted to make sure that I can fit in well with the work culture at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThe 5th and final round was with the hiring manager. It was a 45 minute Skype call. I got a fair idea about job expectations, growth opportunities, challenges and immediate focus areas for this role.It was a very informative discussion.\r\n\r\nI received the news about the job offer in a couple of days. The package was good and I did not have a need to negotiate.\r\n\r\nOverall, the process was very smooth starting with the recruiter making sure that interviews were being scheduled at mutually convenient times. Kudos to the recruitment team at Microsoft! This process was an eye opener to me and helped me understand the diligence and thought process Microsoft has put behind their recruitment process.

After a phone screen, I was told to apply to a Senior position in one of these orgs. I was reluctant because I was aiming for a lower position, but they insisted it was not a problem. That was a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe day of the interview came and went. I felt like I hadn't done that well, I wasn't expecting a callback. I was surprised when their recruiter called me to offer me a position! It was not the level I was applying for, of course, but I was still happy to accept. The recruiter said a hiring manager would get back to me soon.\r\n\r\nThree days pass, and no word from them. I emailed the recruiter to ask what was going on... An automated reply told me she had left the company. I immediately try to call the hiring manager I talked to before... Her phone line was disconnected. In a panic, I reached out to several recruiters within Microsoft in hopes to get some help. Finally somebody responds. Later that day, the new recruiter in charge of my case reaches out. All is good again, although of course I'm not as confident about the process anymore.\r\n\r\nTwo more days pass. I email the new recruiter to ask for a status update. She calls me back... To tell me the team had decided to move on with other candidates \"because I wasn't a good fit for the senior position\".\r\n\r\nIn summary, I was told to apply to a position I was not a good fit for, even though I had concerns. They left me in hiring limbo, without thinking to let me know the points of contact had changed. Finally, they let me go because (surprise) I was not a good fit for the level I applied for.\r\n\r\nThis whole thing feels like a bad joke.",

All the other companies' recruiters have done their due diligence to complete some internal screening process, for example get the hiring manager looking at your qualification before contacting you, except Microsoft. They basically contact me out of whim, then I tried to treat them responsibly by agreeing to setup one hour talk with them, then one or two days latter without solid reason I received a rejection letter, not even going through a technical screen. In this case I have strong background and have very matching skill set the job requires. The funny thing is that my interviews are going well, I already get a few onsite interviews from a few top-notch companies. In another case, I honestly told the recruiter that there are some other Microsoft recruiters pinging me for opportunities, as this early stage, of course as an candidate I'd like to give consideration to more than one teams to test which one is a better match. Out of those companies which are way better than Microsoft, the recruiters basically all take a respective tolerate attitude trying to help you to team matching different teams if you show interest, except Microsoft.

As we began to run out of time more \u201cTrivia\u201d was asked, this time about data structures, then questions for the interviewer and that was the end.\r\nReceived an email 4 days later saying I had advanced to the second round in Redmond, WA.\r\nThe On-Site interview consisted of 4 x 45 minute interviews, one on one with various people from the Azure Cloud team. Each interview had similar structure to the on-campus one: Personality question for the first 5 minutes, then a technical question for the majority, then optional questions for the interviewer at the end.\r\nEach of the on-Site interviewers started off the conversation by introducing themselves and talking about what their position on their respective team was. 3 people from Azure Storage division, one Engineering manager, two normal engineers. The fourth interviewer was an engineer from the Azure Health Division, helping to maintain the backbone of updates to the platform itself.\r\n2 out of the 4 white boarding questions consisted of using Binary Trees with the third question being an Array-based question and the fourth question being a task scheduling question. Once a basic answer was given for each of the questions (with or without written code on the board), the interviewer would proceed to ask about drawbacks to the solution, ask if efficiency could be improved in time or space complexity, then they began modifying the original question to be more restrictive on what could and couldn\u2019t be done (e.g. now solve the problem using O (1) space complexity)\r\nAs we would leave the interview room, the interviewer would either take a picture of the code on the board, or erase the board as we left the room. \r\nOddities about my personal experience:\r\nIn my first interview of the day, once the question was asked and we proceeded to make examples of the question, I was struggling with coming up with a pattern to begin formulating an answer, so the interviewer proceed to make more test cases, however during the process both I and the interviewer became confused multiple times at finding a \u201csolution\u201d to the test cases, miscommunication for understanding each other occurred many times and we never moved onto the coding of the solution before time was up. \r\nAll 4 interviewers were monotonic in their feedback during the coding question, providing few visual or auditory responses whether I was doing a good job or not while presenting my answers. Each of the interviewers presented interest in my personal background however and asked multiple questions for additional details while explaining personal questions before having to move on. \r\nAlthough asked about, none of the interviewers seemed to note or care about data validation for their respective question asked.",

    "review": "My experience with the interview process began with an on-campus interview at my university.  Two weeks later I heard back that I had been given a fly-out. The Microsoft fly out process is extremely unique, and it's clear that they are very interested in you as a candidate based on how well you are compensated during your fly-out. You're given a rental car, a $75/day food budget, an access pass to the employee discount page, and a really nice hoodie (With thumb holes!). \r\n\r\nAs far as the interviews go, I was very impressed with the people I ended up meeting. When you arrive at the office they put you in a room with a lot of other interview candidates, and you are left to mingle for a half-hour or so. Talking with the people there will really give you an idea of the type of person they are looking for; everyone was super smart and sociable. A lot of the intern group ended up going out to dinner later that evening and we all had a group chat going, which I would consider pretty unheard of compared to my other interview experiences. This atmosphere translated over to my interviewers, and I had a very enjoyable experience simply conversing with them. \r\n\r\nHaving compared my interviews with the other candidates, it is really hard for me to suggest what your interviews are going to end up like. Some of the candidates received difficult technical questions, and some, such as myself, received little to none. My suspicion is that the technical questions you get are based on your resume; I have a lot of previous systems design experience, and so I received a lot of systems design and object oriented questions. Conversely, some of the less experienced interns received more algorithms questions. Obviously my sample size isn't that great though. I also received a LOT of behavioral questions. It's no question that the primary purpose of the fly-out, at least for me, was to evaluate whether I would fit into the Microsoft culture. This is probably an important fact to keep in mind, so make sure that you know why you fit into Microsoft before you approach these interviews. You'll find a lot of interviewers provide positive reenforcement when you are talking, so it really helps to open you up to talking about the projects you participated in as well as the mistakes you made and questions you have.\r\n\r\nAll of these awesome experiences in mind, I'm afraid to say I'm a little biased against the process I went through. This is likely due to the fact that I didn't get the offer, but also partially because of my experience afterwords. It's important for you to keep in mind that the actual goal of these interviews is to evaluate yourself; nothing more. In other words, don't expect to be able to solicit any feedback from your interviewers after the process if you don't get the offer. This normally wouldn't be an issue for me, as this isn't really something that you should expect from most interviews. However, for the amount of money and time they spend on you before your interviews, it is very surprising to me that I did not get any responses to my requests for feedback.  This whole interview process was a big detriment on my class performance due to the amount of time I had to dedicate, and unfortunately it is an unsaid requirement that you need to do the fly-out if you really want to be considered. So, if you do choose to do the fly-out, which I still think you should, just know that this whole process will be all-or-nothing save for your own self-reflections post-interview. I would keep this fact in mind mainly if you have any competing offers that you would seriously consider over Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThe above, rather nit-picky complaint aside I really enjoyed the interview, and would highly recommend taking a look at the Microsoft interview process. I definitely learned a lot about myself during the whole thing, and I do think that it has improved my perspective for the future. Good luck!",

I had one interview on my school's campus before making it to the final round in Redmond. The on campus interview was a basic/intermediate data structures question, while the final round tested more than just programming - they want to see ability to problem solve. Thinking on your feet is extremely important in the final round, since you will most likely get at least one type of curveball question that you can't really prepare for (similar to a work environment). At the end of the 4 interviews, you get the rest of the day in the Seattle area with the other interviewees, which took a lot of pressure off of the entire interview day. Overall, it was a very seamless process that tested how you perform in different situations, but also allowed you to meet students from around the world and have time to explore the campus as well as the surrounding area.",

    "review": "I would like to start out by saying this has been by far been the worst, most poorly handled, and longest (by a long shot) interview experience I've ever had to deal with. \r\n\r\nIt started out with a phone screen, the developer over the phone made me excited for the team I wanted to interview for. The talk was great. I moved onto the onsite after getting the news I did well over the phone and giving my initial recruiter total compensation expectancies as well as additional information. \r\n\r\nThe onsite went really well. All of the members of the team that I interviewed with, as well as other developers in the org, made me really want to come work there. Most of them seemed excited about their work and they all seemed like people I would want to work with.\r\n\r\nWaiting to hear back took a couple of long weeks. I had no insight into what was going on behind the scenes. Some time later I received a phone call from my first (yes, first and honestly it may have been the second) recruiter saying that I \"needed\" to come in... onsite, and have another interview with a different hiring manager for a different team. I took another day off and did that.\r\n\r\nThis mainly consisted of telling me that my interview feedback was good, and that they would have openings in the near future and that they would want to extend an offer at that point, but I just needed to hold out and wait. He explained the team, which was something even more in my wheel house, which made me even more excited, this time knowing for sure that I would have an offer coming my way.\r\n\r\nAnother couple of weeks later, I receive an email from yet another new recruiter who didn't have any of the original information I had previously given my last recruiter. She wasn't even completely up to date on what teams I had interviewed with or what my story was. No big deal, I gave her all of the information, but clearly no communication from internal recruiters.\r\n\r\nEventually I was made an offer. In my opinion, knowing what other developers were being offered, it was a really low ball offer. I had explained I would actually be losing money with the offer they made me. The recruiter took the offer back to the hiring manager with my comments and a few days later contacted me saying she wanted to talk again about my offer.\r\n\r\nShe was very blunt when we finally got on the phone. She explained what she thinks she would have been able to do for me compensation wise, but said she had bad news. She told me they lost the head count and would be pulling the offer off the table, and that she was sorry. \r\n\r\nI have since tried to contact my recruiter to see if their is possibly other teams within the org that could use my positive interview feedback for a hire, but she is no longer responding. \r\n\r\nUltimately, it's time to move on. This experience has made me question why I was even excited to work at Microsoft in the first place. If this is how awful the recruiting/budgeting and hiring process is, it makes me wonder what else is like this internally at Microsoft. All in all, just a terrible experience where I was a hot potato with very little insight and clarity into what was actually happening after being told I would receive an offer.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Microsoft isn't actually offering as much as some other smaller companies. If money is something that is important to you, you'll be better off not dealing with this and looking elsewhere.",

I asked a few questions to clarify the inputs, like does our input fit into memory, should our function print or return a flag.\r\n\r\nAfter the clarifications, I started discussing the naive approach by initialising a new array of string length and reverse copy the old string into a new array from index 0 and compare old and new array elements.

The hiring manager and a senior developer who will take my phone interview, were marked in the Cc of that email sent by the recruiter. I was very excited and asked the Senior Developer to schedule the phone interview ASAP (mistake). I got a call scheduled 5 days later and it was 60 minutes talk on the phone, I was literally sweating from head to toe. It was not that difficult, but he asked me about some of my academic projects which I was not prepared for and posed a system design challenge, I am sure I didn't give him the answer he wanted. He phrased the question in 5-6 different ways, still not satisfied with my answer. Kudos to his patience. Finally we ended the call and he said the recruiter will get back to me soon.\r\n\r\nA week later, recruiter emails me saying the hiring team wants to fly me to Seattle for onsite interview. I replied saying I am ready to fly as early as possible (MISTAKE) and I was given the date of last Monday of August month. It was exactly 7 days from the day I got this email.\r\n\r\nMy interview started at 11:30, the interviewer asked me couple of very simple Data structure questions and I wrote the code on white board, while thinking out loud. After interacting for an hour, we went to cafeteria. Then he brought me back to the building after finishing eating and left me at the next interviewer's office. This person was very honest and told me that I'm the first guy he's interviewing. He had couple of CPP pointer related problems ready on white board and one SQL question. I struggled a bit in solving them, the interviewer helped me a lot. After one hour, I was left at the office of the team manager. She was very sweet and friendly. Talked for 20 minutes about mutual interests and jumped to system design questions. I wasn't able to cover all the scenarios, but talked about the important ones which did matter. She helped me to understand the rest. Then for my surprise, she said her manager might wanna meet me and dropped me off at the lobby and told me I had 30 mins break. After 30 mins, the senior manager took me to her office and it was all about how much I wanna do the stuffs which they are working on and behavioral questions and again a system design question. It was all good and easy to be honest. I sent an email to the recruiter, asking him to thank the team on my behalf.\r\n\r\n3 days later, I got an email from the recruiter saying I don't have the required years of experience for the job role and that is the reason hiring manager has decided not to move forward with my candidacy.",

It might be possible that the code fails for boundary conditions.\r\n\r\n2nd Round- Pen Paper coding test (Group Fly)\r\n2 questions in 60 mins. All the students were divided into groups of 6-7. We had to write the code considering all the possible cases and boundary conditions. 2-3 from each group were selected.  \r\n\r\n3rd Round - 1st Interview\r\n2 questions were asked. After a little discussion about the efficient solution, I was asked to write code for both the questions.\r\n\r\n4th Round- 2nd Interview\r\nAgain 2 questions were asked and had to write code for the same.

We got through my current and previous work places and talk about projects and technologies. After that I was asked two technical questions and the interview ended. During the interview I got positive feedback on all my answers and was told that my experience, specialization and the knowledge fits the group and the position.\r\nOn the next day I got a rejection letter.

    "review": "Telephone interview with HR followed by a technical Skype video interview which covers your understanding of .Net through to your feelings about open source & security policies of large organisations. This would have been an ideal opportunity for Microsoft to filter out candidates that had not recently used very extensive Azure and products such as Dynamics CRM at the depth they require, yet they passed me through to the face to face process and wasted my time further.\r\n\r\nAn on-site interview takes place during a specific \"recruitment\" day on which they process many candidates quickly. I was asked to prepare a presentation on Microsoft products, you get about three days to prepare if your life can spare it.\r\n\r\nI was left in reception far longer than I would ever consider leaving an interviewing candidate at my company, but what would I know? I'm a dev manager for a small outfit not a corporate.\r\n\r\n The \u201clogistics\u201d section tells you to prepare a 25 minute \u201ctalk\u201d followed by QA and bring your own laptop (not sure why they naturally assume everyone has a laptop) I recommend you ignore the \u201clogistics\u201d section as I wasted an entire Saturday preparing a slide based talk for the exact time they specified and practiced with my other half to get the timing perfect.  Also ignore the bit where it tells you not to introduce yourself as they won't have read that bit and may take a disliking to you, I suspect that did not go well for me.\r\n\r\nOn the day they wanted to treat it more like a discussion with two guys firing quite cynical 'knowing' questions at me every time I spoke, with the excuse that it was \"role-playing as a dev team they might deal with\" but derailed it completely as stopping to answer the questions or go back to a previous slide they wanted to pick holes in took up all the time. Just felt like lazy interviewing and quite disrespectful to candidates that have literally just arrived at Microsoft. My impression was they were very corporate, and it wouldn't be a nice place to work.\r\n\r\nThey delighted in stopping me if I even mentioned anything they didn't feel was relevant to their vague memory of the spec (which they admitted they neither had or read recently).\r\n\r\n I was unhappy to have taken a day off and traveled to Microsoft to be treated in a manner I considered unprofessional. I wasted time preparing a hands-on demonstration using Azure which they didn't want to see as there was no time left which I had little control over. The questions were quite cynical and there was some muttering and laughing at my slides and criticising. This would not be a good interview for someone who was unable to infer this hidden expectation from the logistics section of an interview preparation document, for example, I am quite capable of hiring someone with autism but Microsoft would not be IMHO. \r\n\r\nAs I had to give the presentation first, that just left a bad taste in my mouth. They said that this was normal as their customers are quite unpleasant to them. I've worked with dev teams world-wide and we all have challenging customers but only corporate mentality can expect to use it as an excuse for a confusing ambiguous interview technique. \r\n\r\nThe later technical interview was good and the guys handling it were professional, but I was completely phased by the presentation debacle so could not concentrate. Expect the standard corporate white board and practice communicating architecture visually. Enjoyed the business interview too.\r\n\r\nHad no interest in working for Microsoft following the presentation experience and won't be recommending it to any devs on my teams now or in the future. \r\n\r\nThe feedback was that I was nervous during my presentation and lost eye contact in my business interview\" at one point\" so make sure you stare those suckers out to the end.",

Then got a call that I need to make interview trip within a week and a half. Took the time off for the interview. Microsoft pays for hotel and flight but at least in my case it was a 6 hour flight in a middle seat both ways. The team I was going to be working with is local so it\u2019s not clear why trip was necessary. When interview was scheduled I got an email stating that I will be getting a call confirming interview details the day before. Never got a call so wasn\u2019t sure if it was still on. Had to reach out to recruiter and HR to find out if interview was on. Turned out HR was on vacation. Recruiter confirmed interview was still on but didn\u2019t have details. \r\nFlew in. Got interview details, who I m meeting and when. \r\nNone of the interviewers had my resume prior to the interview and neither did HR. Somehow they couldn\u2019t download it from Microsoft career website. \r\nMet my first interviewer on time. The meeting room that the interview was scheduled in actually doesn\u2019t exist in the building. Interviewer was very nice. Discussion lasted about an hour. Then was told team has meetings so I have  to hang out for 2 hours and wait for next interviewer. I got free lunch while waiting. \r\nQuestions were mostly straight forward not difficult. Interview team were all immigrants from India. I am an immigrant too, so it just looked not diverse.  Interviewers were polite and courteous. Sent them a thank you and waited.  2 weeks passed. Reached out to find out hey\r\nor nay. Recruiter eventually called back and said although interview went great they went with another candidate who is a better fit, whatever that means.

I felt it was good but unfortunately didn't hear anything from them which I deduced that I did  not get through.  It took more than a month to schedule two rounds of Interview.

Recruiter - Mostly emails for setting up phone interview and also shares the form to fill. Make sure the salary expectation range is what you want when you get hired, so that its easier to negotiate latter.Some recruiters also calls and shares the from by email. Sometimes they just call and then set phone interview (but i am not sure on this, forgot).\r\n\r\n3. Phone interview - either with manager or team member or any developer in that group. If it is Core services group then you will get an invitation to do online test without any phone interview Or if it is an event they also send you the online test.\r\n\r\n4. Onsite interview - 4 interviews plus 1 more interview with higher grade people (either its manager's manager or groups big heads). Based on my knowledge if you are interviewed by the 5th person, higher chance of getting a job. But i have been interviewed by 5th person and got job, also once did not get a job. 5th interview is not mandatory, if you don't do well mostly they wont have 5th interview. It also happened to me once.\r\n\r\n1st interviewer - Will ask general questions like, how is your current work environment process and also will answer any questions we have about the process. This is more high level interview seem to me like they are checking whether we fit in their system. It seems that they typically likes to hire developers who do development, testing, deployment, monitoring, support (like on call). It is rare i think they will ask you algorithm question, but i have been asked once. This person usually will be a team lead or little bit higher within the team. In this interview  you will have enough time to ask questions.\r\n\r\n2nd interviewer  - will ask algorithm  questions and will ask to write on board. \r\n\r\n3rd interviewer (lunch interview) - Some times 2nd interview will also be lunch interview. So i am referring here which ever one is the lunch interview. They take you to lunch usually within Microsoft cafeteria, will ask about system design questions. Usually you will see a senior developer here. System design will either be asked at lunch or will be taken to a room after lunch and asked. Sometimes they ask at lunch and also take to the room and ask a little algorithm question. But this interview is mostly focused on system design. \r\n\r\n4th interview - will ask algorithm questions and ask to write on whiteboard.\r\n\r\n5th interview (optional) - If you have this probability of you hired is high. For me it happened twice, once i got the job, once did not.\r\n\r\nI have not attended an event in Microsoft, so not sure about that process.",

At that point it was time for lunch.  They provided a decent catered lunch for us.  During lunch the panel meets and decides who they want to have give their presentations.  If you are not asked to present, then you are out of the running.  \r\n\r\nI was asked to present in front of all the folks I previously had met.  Presentation went well, and I was then dismissed and began to wait for feedback from the recruiter.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I was told to wait 5-10 business days.  After not hearing back by business day  # 11 I decided to email the recruiter and ask for a status.  I was actively interviewing at the time and needed to know where I stood.  I got no reply.  \r\n\r\nOn business day # 13 I decided to call the recruiter and ask for an update.  No answer, and her mailbox was full so I could not leave a message.  I then sent another email.  \r\n\r\nOn day # 14 I got an email back saying she was on vacation but would try to get an update for me.  I responded asking when she was returning so I would not bothering her while she was away.  I got no reply.  \r\n\r\nOn day # 20 I emailed yet again and asked if she was still on vacation (At this point had no intention of accepting an offer, I was following up as a matter of principal).  I got a reply within 2 minutes this time and was told the team chose someone else but she had no specific feedback for me at the time, but would try to get something for me.  It is now a month later, I am still waiting on that feedback.  \r\n\r\nI have no issue at all with them selecting another candidate, that is fine.  However, considering the fact that I took a day off of work, prepared an interview presentation, and spent the better part of a day interviewing, I feel I deserve at least the courtesy and respect of an answer, without having to chase people down like I did.  Or at least re-set my expectations with regards to when I should expect an answer.  Don't tell me 5-10 days and then ignore all of my inquires when the time has passed.  No one at MS can respond to candidate when a single recruiter goes on vacation?  If this is how they treat potential employees, I wonder how they treat their clients?  Probably best that I found a better opportunity.",

First a phone screening discussing your work history and some behavioral questions, then two 45 min back to back interviews. One is a role-play that should take 15-20 mins and then 15 min debrief, then a 30-45 mins situational/behavioral interview. Once you've passed that round you'll get moved on to an interview with the hiring manager. That's basically another 30-45 min interview again of behavioral and situational things and discussing your work history. It took me about 2 weeks to a month before I heard back.

I would classify them as Leetcode easy, since they are pretty standard questions. However, I believe, the interviewer had a hard time understanding the solution I was trying to convey. This wasn't necessarily due to communication gaps, but more because, the interviewer had some solution in mind while asking the question and I did not spit out the exact one they wanted. I did not expect this from a company like Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThere were no questions about thought process, algorithm efficiency and time-space trade-off discussions. \r\n\r\nOverall it was a really bad experience.

This was not the initial \"informal chat\" that was described. Was pretty awkward half on a poor skype call.\r\n\r\nI was failed at final stage (described as a non-technical interview) for technical skills despite having already passed the technical interview. Two managers felt better placed to make a technical decision than their technical interviewers I guess? Based on my experience I'd say to not adapt your interview style based on interviewers, ie stay technical, don't focus entirely on managerial/soft-skills in the management interview.\r\n\r\nMS asked some concerning questions in the interview too which started with phrases like \"Given this is the very top tier support, customers expect you to be a SME on everything so how would you cover your lack of knowledge\" which concerns me due to complete lack of transparency and potential for making mistakes due to 'covering up' your lack of skills.\r\n\r\nI felt there was also a concerning number of questions asked in relation to dealing with customers in other countries or cultures. Their questioning went beyond what I feel was a reasonable line of concern for someone dealing with customers.",

They asked me to solve a string manipulation problem. I did in two minutes then left the question and started talking about encryption and decryption. I was asked things I wouldn't expect at all from a 1 year experienced person. All I can say is that it was ridiculous.\r\n\r\nFifth interview was with a manager who has worked for 27 years at MSFT.

I really enjoyed their approach of starting with a technical question and either diving deep or moving on depending on my experience. They made a kind effort to move the interview in the direction of where I am strong at (app dev, cloud architecture & monitoring).

I had to go through HR, my future manager, my future N+2, but also had to face a 2h \"panel interview\". To this end, I was asked to prepare a 30' presentation describing a project where my contribution made a difference. No more guidance than that: it was not about picking up the most successful project, nor the one I was most proud of, but choosing one where my personal contribution could be clearly established. For the first hour of the panel review, I delivered my presentation and was asked challenging questions by the interviewers (around 5 of them). They had received the deck beforehand and it was obvious that all of them had read it in full and prepared thoroughly. Then we transitioned to the second part, where I was given 10' to prepare  C-level conversation about \"how to eradicate Windows XP\". The assignment was to structure the topic into a consultative planning conversation whereby I could convince a decision-maker that I understood the stakes and could be the right man to lead such a transformation. Needless to say that I knew very little about the technical aspects of a WinXP migration, so I built on my consulting background to focus at methodology, team building, phased approach, risk management, etc. They were thrilled, but only after having shot dozens of questions at me! Overall this was the best hiring experience, not only because I genuinely enjoyed it but also because I got a first-hand feel of what my future job would be.

The process includes- 4 F2F interviews...3 technical/programming/problem solving rounds followed by 1 design round. One HR person was proactively coordinating every rounds of interview for each of candidates. I had to go to Hyderabad (travel was arranged by Microsoft) to complete design round.\r\n\r\nEach round includes brief discussion about your profile, key challenges faced, how those challenges were solved etc. Then, some programming/problem solving / design questions. For me, design round was taken by hiring manager (one of the top guys in MSIDC) and it was the toughest rounds among all.\r\n\r\nWhen you are asked to write code, please make sure that you consider all boundary cases, syntax etc... They will observe everything- how you approach the problem, find solution, your implementation. And every view is respected, discussed... Correct answers are good but thought process is most important for them... You should make sure, you ask sufficient amount of questions during/before coming up the solutions.\r\n\r\nThis was the by far the best interview I have attended till now (including amazon interview experience). I was initially considered for SDE II but when I receive an offer, I was given Senior Software Engineer. They offered me very good package as well.\r\n\r\nTheir recruitment team moves very fast.

There were a total of 5 interviews (I'm told if you don't do well in the first few, they dismiss you after lunch).  The first 4 interviews begin with a coding problem, and if there's time left over, you have the opportunity to ask the interviewer any questions you want.  The lunch interview involves some casual conversation to get to know you a little better followed by a short coding problem.

Also had to solve a simple coding task, described how I would test it.\r\n\r\nThen got an invitation to onsite interview. After 2 weeks of preparation, I flew to Oslo.\r\nWhen I came to the office receptionist just asked to wait for the first interviewer. No speaking to HR, no showing the office. Nothing about the team. Nothing.\r\nOk, no problem. I waited for the first interview. I had a long way (flight with 1 stop through Germany), but the first question from the interviewer was \"Do you live in Oslo?\". They did not know anything about me. Even that I flew thousands of kilometers before the interview.\r\n\r\nThey did not provide any information about the position, areas they can ask about, nothing like that. And since my CV is full of web experience, this is exactly what I expected. Plus, as usual, algorithms and data structures. But I was really wrong...\r\n\r\nThe first interview was more or less ok. Typical theoretical questions about c#, then small algorithm task.\r\n\r\nThe second was very good. The task was related to trees, I solved it, discussed time complexity.\r\n\r\nThe third was really strange! Instead of questions related to my experience and typical CS issues, they asked me some strange things like \"writing objects into files using stream\"...what? There was very long preview about user permissions, I thought the issue is related to security somehow and I need to develop auth service or something like that. But after the preview, they asked me to...write security object to a file. At first, I even though I did not get the question right. Why do that? What for? A task without any context. Just write an object to file. Ok, I did, of course with lots of stupid clarification questions because had no idea what I am doing and why. So the task itself was like in kindergarten speaking about its difficulty. But the way how it was presented, that is amazing. I still cannot understand why not to ask \"write an object with int, bool and string properties into a file\" - and that's it! Why spend our time explaining that useless information about user permissions if the question was absolutely not related to security?\r\n\r\nThe fourth was better than third but still strange. Normal tasks but with several suggestions like \"let's assume this, let's assume that\".\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, I waited for the whole month! And only after I sent an email like \"is there any feedback?\" I got rejecting email next day.\r\n\r\nThat was one of the strangest interviews I ever had. A simple task without context becomes something without any sense. And you have to solve this in a better way.",

I reached on time and was asked to wait in a meeting room booked for interviews. The first interview was with a lady. I can't explain how horrible the experience was with this arrogant lady. She had such a grilling attitude. The only thing she was trying to do throughout the interview was finding ways to let me down. \r\n\r\nOne of the questions she asked was related to website performance improvements, where one of the things I told was bundling css/js assets. To this she said why would you bundle CSS files for all of your site. I never said that you'll bundle everthing. I explained to her that bundling has to follow some strategies, its not that you bundle CSS for all your site together. But she was in no mood to listen.\r\n\r\nAnother thing she asked was infinite scroll, where I mentioned about how you can debounce your requests. She literally had no idea what debounce is. I explained like with continuous scroll when the user takes a short break in the scroll event for suppose 50ms, we fire an API request event. To this her reply was that you want the user to take a coffee break and come back. I was shocked to hear that. By this time I was frustrated enough and knew MS is not the right place to be for front end engineers. Their interviewees don't know the basic concept of debounce and throttle.\r\n\r\nThen the discussion moved to stores in redux. She asked me about the flow in redux and design a store in redux. I created an EventEmitter class that has subscribers and emits event on state change. And that is how it actually works. But she was dumb enough to understand. \r\n\r\nThen she asked me to write a class for Actions and Reducers. What?? Actions are plain JS objects and reducers are nothing but normal functions that take in the state and action and transform the state acordingly. But she never understood. She still wanted me to implement a class for Actions and Reducers.\r\n\r\nThis interview was the worst experience I ever had in my life. Looked like the interviewee was a hire from some women special hiring drive.\r\n\r\nThe second interview was good enough. The guy asked me to code a plugin for list virtualization and assisted me through. We had a great discussion and finished the interview.\r\n\r\nAfter sometime, while waiting in the room, I get a call from the HR that you can leave for the day, we'll update you. The HR didn't even come and escort me out, although he was there in office and the office is a small one. I had to find my way out. Such unprofessional people.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I got to learn MS is definitely not the right place for Javascript/ Front End guys. \r\n\r\nAdvice to MS: Give some training to your interviewees. And teach some manners to your HR.",

Extremely slow communication and a lot of tiring back and forth just waiting for the interview to be set up. Radio silence for a couple weeks. I thought a company like Microsoft would be more professional. Two of four interviewers didn\u2019t turn their cameras on in one on one interviews, which makes it harder to get a good conversation going. After the final interview,  more radio silence and I had to follow up, was told to wait yet another week after waiting weeks already. I\u2019m sure experiences vary a lot, but mine was garbage.",

Questions about why you want to work there and situational questions like tell me about a time you did X.\r\n\r\nIf you pass that round, you\u2019ll go straight to the final round. Final round is 2x45 min calls, each with 2 interviewers. The first video call will be with 2 people in the team you\u2019re shortlisted for. My interviewers were highly dismissive. The second was with more senior leaders in the company and it was the only enjoyable part of the whole process.\r\n\r\nAfter these interviews, dead silence for months. No email, call, nothing. After investing much of your time as a candidate, making it to the final round and emailing them multiple times about an update, no acknowledgement whatsoever and zero respect for the candidates\u2019 efforts and time.\r\n\r\nThey made an information session for uni students who were shortlisted after the first round on how to prepare for the final round interviews. It was friendly and they made it seem like we could ask them anything. But somehow, they can\u2019t respond to emails.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t know if this is the same process in the US but the APAC University recruiting team is the worst, most unresponsive and unhelpful recruiters I\u2019ve ever met - starting to wonder if they hate their job too.",

I had sent several follow-up emails and they did not even bother to respond. Absolutely no consideration for my time, money and effort! \r\n\r\nIn hindsight, I am happy to not have received an offer. They hire employees on contract and under a local Canadian hiring agency. You can not even call yourself a Microsoft employee! They pay you by the hour(!) and you do not get any benefits or paid time off(!). This company has mastered slavery in the 21st century. From my interactions with Microsoft employees in Missisauga and Toronto, I have realized that they are not valued in any manner whatsoever.

Had to describe these concepts as if I was explaining  it to someone who is not technical. I think she was looking to see if I was able to communicate my thoughts clearly. Then was given an algorithm.\r\n\r\nSecond round was with a senior engineer who focused more on my projects and how everything was working. We went more deeply on why I used these specific frameworks/databases. Then started going over basic web security topics and then ended the interview with another algorithm.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, I had my long interview with another senior engineer. This was more focused on my skills and knowledge with object-oriented programming. He gave a very vague description of what I was suppose to design and was expecting me to talk through everything. Then ended with a few data structure questions\r\n\r\nMy last interview was with the hiring manager and just talked more about how teams are structured and how everyone works together.

When I pinged him again on December 6th, he replied and we had a phone conversation. He told me that he will forward my resume to hiring managers in Azure. He then disappeared again for 2 weeks. When I pinged him again just after christmas, he said he will get back to me again. He again disappeared and finally replied on 10th January that couple of teams in Azure are interested. He asked me send him over time slots for phone screening. I did and then it was radio silence again. In first week of february, recruiter told me to send my new availabilities for phone screenign. I did again. Finally my phone screen was set.\r\n\r\nThe phone screen was held using Skype for business, which does not have client for Ubuntu. So I managed to get hold of a mac for interview. The interviewer also did not know how to use the Skype for business. He asked me some design questions. At the end when I asked interviewer about when I should expect to hear from recruiter, he said \"Your guess is as good as mine\". When I told him about the long process I have been part of,  he promised to expedite the process. And sure enough after 3 days I learned that I have cleared the phone screening.\r\n\r\nBut recruiter called me and told me that I should not have complained about the long time for me to get phone screening and it looks bad for me and I should refrain from mentioning this again in on-site interview.  It has been a week, but my onsite has not been scheduled, despite me telling the recruiter that I have other interviews lined up. It doesn't matter, as I am not going on on-site interview anyway.",

Recruiting started working with me about a week later.  The entire process with informational and recruiting took over 7 weeks.  Final answer was delayed by over a week.  Despite having all qualifications, ample experience and a great rapport in all interviews I was not offered the role.  They hired internally instead, reason given: the other candidate had more experience.  Subsequently, I pursued another role with a different team (again with a referral), and during that interview the manager felt there would not be enough to challenge me due to my level of experience.  So, I seem to fit a very narrow niche?  A good hiring team would work with a candidate like me to find the right fit.  The trouble with Microsoft recruiting is, that they all work in silos, they support a business unit, not a job category.  The likelihood of another EA role coming up in the same business unit in the next several weeks is slim to none.  So, if you interview at MS again, you are starting at ground zero, beginning with an informational, a phone interview, then a full day of loops and most likely weeks of waiting.",

I explained that at my current job I am doing 70% testing 30% and that even though I really enjoy testing I am very willing and open to software egineering! I felt like he based his decision on that and that in my upionion is unfair. He sent me an online assessment which I did super well on, but unfortunately they decided to go with other applicatant. In their email they encouraged to reach out to my recruiter with any questions I may have. Because I knew did well on their assesmet, I wanted to understand where my application was lacking so that I can improve for future opportunities.

    "review": "Got a referral end of October and got email inviting me to an on campus interview at my university about a month later. On campus interview pretty easy question. About 3-4 hours after my 8am on campus interview, got an email inviting me to the Superday. Superday was on Thursday and consisted of 4 back to back interviews with members of the same team. My interviewers were 3 engineers and 1 manager. All questions leetcode easy/medium. Google and FB phone screens were more difficult than the Microsoft onsite. Unlike Google, amazon, & fb, you are directly compared to the other 7 people the team you\u2019re interviewing with also interviews that day. Team is probably hiring 1-2 new grads so if someone answers a question slightly better or is more likable as a person you probably won\u2019t get it. I personally thought I did really well, one of the best final round interviews I\u2019ve ever given. I answered every question correctly with time left. However, another candidates may have been more charismatic or something. Got a generic email rejection the following Monday and they provided no feedback. Process was super organized and they gave us a stipend for lunch in the cafeteria after interviews ended",

    "review": "I was approached by a university recruiter, who was very helpful and considerate towards the kind of role that would suit me. We quickly found out that a PM internship would be the best. What followed was an initial phone screen to get to know each other. \r\n \r\nA few weeks later I had my first phone interview with another PM, which took about an hour. I was asked some personality questions and had to  describe some university software projects I had worked on, my biggest challenges in these projects etc. Afterwards I was asked some basic technical questions where I had to explain a few concepts of computer science. (I have a Computer Science background). In the end I had about 15 minute time to solve a logic problem. Finally, there was some time to chat with the PM and ask questions.\r\n\r\nA couple more weeks past and I was invited to the on-site interview. The entire process was extremely pleasant, because MS took care of booking my flight and hotel. They were also very considerate towards exams and respected my time preference. The on-site interview day consisted of four approx. one-hour interviews, with 15-min breaks in between. Throughout the whole day you have access to water, juice, fruits, and snacks on the table. These interviews were with different PM's and team leaders and were similar in structure: A short introduction, some personality questions, then the main part, aka design/technical questions, finally time for your questions. I felt comfortable and properly equipped to answer the design/technical questions. The reason why I selected that it was a \"difficult\" interview, is because being highly concentrated for 4-5 hours is very exhausting. Towards the last interview I could feel my performance worsen, because I was on low energy. I highly recommend that you eat and hydrate properly before your interview! \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to point out that both the recruiters and the interviewers made me feel extremely comfortable and welcome at all times, which was ultimately one of the main reasons why I accepted the offer. The culture that I felt at MS was one of true inclusion and camaraderie. Although I knew I was being evaluated, I never felt like it. The interviews (even the ones that seemed to test how you work under pressure) felt like a group project, that I was an equal member of. This atmosphere allowed me to be comfortable and my best self, which ultimately led to my success.  My recruiters were amazing too, they were personally involved in every step of the way, kept in touch and replied to emails and questions very promptly and professionally throughout the entire process.",

    "review": "I applied online in early September 2017. I also had a referral from an employee. After about a week I received an e-mail from my school's recruiter to schedule a phone interview for later that month.\r\n\r\nI got the impression that my phone interviewer did not work directly at Microsoft. This was not strictly a bad thing but I felt like I was being judged more on my communication skills than my abilities. She asked me some basic general and behavioral questions, including why I wanted to work at Microsoft and to go over a project I had worked on. She asked some followup questions about my project, like how I tested it, but it felt like she was reading the questions off of a list. Finally she asked me a logic problem. She actually cut me off after I gave the right answer to the problem when I was trying to make sure it was correct (she wasn't rude; she just seemed like she was content hearing the right answer).\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to point out is that my project was in Python, and this interviewer really wanted to make sure that I could program in a C-style language. She said I would need to program in a C-style language for the on-site if I moved on. Maybe this is their official policy, but I knew from talking to other people that it wasn't true. I assured her I could program in C++, which was the truth. I bring this up because I got the feeling that if I had been more modest about my C++ abilities, she actually wouldn't have passed me.\r\n\r\nI didn't hear anything for a few weeks. Then I received an e-mail from my school's recruiter that I had done \"well\" on the phone screen but that they were full on interview spots at the moment and that I would hear back sometime in the next 2-8 (!!) weeks. I finally heard back in late November when I got an e-mail telling me they had on-site spots in January, and if I was still available I could schedule. I responded immediately saying I was available and then I was given a link to schedule on one of 4 or 5 dates, but one of the dates was in early December, so I chose that. They arranged and paid for my airfare and hotel, and gave me a ridiculous reimbursable food budget for each day.\r\n\r\nThe on-site interviews began at 8am. They interviewed a whole group of people at the same time. We were given a light breakfast buffet and told by a recruiter how the interviews would work. Interviews were 45 minutes each, with a 10-15 minute break between each one. Every single interview followed the same format: they asked me to tell them about myself, and then they asked some questions about the projects I'd been working on. I was honestly surprised that they had all read my resume, and one of them had even checked my github and was familiar with one of my projects. (This really impressed me, to be honest.) Then we spent 20-30 minutes on a whiteboard problem.\r\n\r\nThe whiteboard problems were all medium or medium-easy in difficulty, but dressed up a little bit so they weren't just literally ripped from some book/website. None of the interviewers cared what language I used and they seemed much more interested in the approach to the problem rather than the code's correctness. Every interviewer was very nice.\r\n\r\n(Also, I had a bit of a break at one point and someone from HR sat down and talked to me. This was just a coincidence, NOT an interview, but they were still super nice and honestly it was my favorite conversation of the day.)\r\n\r\nWhen the interviews were over at noon we were taken over as a group to the commons building and given a free lunch. After that we went back to our hotels.\r\n\r\nI got my offer 2 days later, but that's because I had a deadline for another company.\r\n\r\nOverall my only complaint was how long the whole process took. Near the end there was a real danger that I'd have to accept another offer before finishing up with Microsoft. The process itself was very pleasant and my interviewers were all nice. I would also have liked a bit of a tour of some buildings or working areas but that's not a huge deal.",

At the time I was unfamiliar with Microsoft ranks, so I didn't realize that I was grossly underqualified for Senior SDE with only 2.5 years industry experience. Luckily they must've realized this and adjusted my application for an SDE II role.\r\n\r\nThe onsite process was excellent. I would say better Google, who makes you book your own flight. Probably second only to Facebook because they included an excellent breakfast buffet at the hotel I went to. The hotel I got was decent, but the breakfasts contained no meats, which was disappointing. I managed to wrangle the flight times to give me an extra couple of days, and they gave me 2 nights in the hotel and 4! days with the car, which was perfect. Highly recommend.\r\n\r\nInterview itself was really fun. Microsoft's hiring process is a lot more granular than other Big N companies, because you apply for a specific team and that's the team who interviews you. In this way, it's more important to impress on a social level, because the hiring folks will be working with you directly. \r\n\r\nMy interviews were more design and theory focused than normal, but that's not necessarily typical. One thing that stood out to me was that \"lunch\", was actually the third interview. This really tripped me out because normally you eat lunch with a neutral guy, so I was chatting with my guy and afterwards he's like, okay lets go to my office and do some problems. They pay for your lunch, but be sure not to get the pizzas or grill stuff, because it takes way too long. Get a soup, some bread, and look for cues in the eating pace of your interviewer. Also, this way you wont eat too much and get sleepy.",

After our initial call he then seemed to not be able to answer any calls and only returned emails after 10pm which does nobody any good. The day of our prep call which was the day before my job interview he all of a sudden had phone problems and kept disconnecting on me. Which I understand that stuff like that happens but after the second disconnection he didn't even have the professional decency to email me to tell me he would call me when his phone was back to working. Instead I had emailed him a few times seeing if we could finish the prep and he didn't respond at all. Hands down the worst experience I have had with any corporate recruiter. This recruiter also told me 2 days after the interview I would have an answer and that was not the case either. A week later I had to send out a few emails asking what was going on in which all I got was a generic email from a different recruiter. This sourcer should really evaluate the way they do their job.

    "review": "Interviewing with Microsoft left a bad taste in my mouth. I think it was mainly because of the fact that they gave a take home assignment, which took candidates' time, but didn't seem to adequately winnow down the applicant pool before disseminating the assignment. They were extremely professional and I didn't have to deal with recruiters, but instead dealt with the team itself. But I feel as though they're wasting candidates' time, and were not exactly transparent about the fact that they were dealing with such a large applicant pool. \r\n\r\nThe first interview was a case. The second round was a take home test about the smartphone industry. The next round would have been an onsite, but I didn't make it that far. Obviously they gave a bunch of candidates the assignment. In the rejection email they said they had high interest, from both internal and external candidates. So, basically they gave like 10-30 candidates a test only to waste their time. Internal candidates likely were at an advantage to begin with.  I think there should perhaps be a separate process for internal vs. external. They should look at internal candidates first, and if they don't fit the role, only then should they look at external candidates.  Having internal and external candidates in the same applicant pool is a mistake. \r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, they said I have the skillet they're looking for, but they're going to go with people that have more extensive tech/strategy experience.  Which is contradictory, no? At the end of the day Microsoft shouldn't waste people's time with a take home assignment if they haven't even done an adequate job of narrowing the applicant pool. It would be one thing if this assignment was done at the beginning or even the end. But it was done in the middle. It lacked transparency  and candidates deserve better. They shouldn't be required to invest time in an assignment, with the applicant pool still being relatively large at that stage. A more extensive case might have been more fitting for the second phase of the interview. Maybe use a take home assignment for the final stage of the process, when candidates are going for the onsite. Then they can present their findings during the course of the interview.",

And when they are ready, they expected me to drop everything including essentially asking me to cancel an upcoming vacation out of the country. I told them  well ahead of time my unavailable dates. \r\n\r\nIt was their way or the highway. They had the nerve to ask me to do a Skype interview from out of the country while on vacation (with hiking clothes). They expected me to respond and book travel for the onsite interview while I was out of the country with very limited reception, which I told them. I was given ONE day to prepare a 4-hour interview along with presentation. The recruiter said one day prior, \"oh, didn't I mention that?\" No! I had to scramble to put together in one day. Jet-lagged and as prepared as one can be.\r\n\r\nAt the onsite interview, Microsoft expected me to know pricing questions on essentially all of their products. How would I know pricing to each product as an outsider?!  Questions about SaaS and PaaS. I came to find out that they didn't like anyone they interviewed before me. I was the excuse the hiring manager needed to hire someone he had in mind who is  internal. Guess interviewing me as the external candidate is to quiet and appease HR. Hiring manager's body language was obvious. He also said to me at the beginning, \"I only have a few minutes.\" \r\n\r\nDays go by and I never heard back from the recruiter after the onsite interview. \r\n\r\nI was treated like dirt from beginning to end, including the admin person at the Phoenix office front desk. Because the interview was 4 hours (with 4 different people), I was given lunch (thanks, warden). When I went to get my sandwich, the admin person said \"you should wait until everyone has had their turn picking their first choice!\" \r\n\r\nSuch unprofessional experience from beginning to end. I don't think I will ever consider them again. Felt used. Don't think the hiring manager ever gave me a chance. He just needed to check off his list that he interviewed an external candidate with a lot of experience.\r\n\r\nThis is the first interview review I have written about any company. Microsoft stood out the worst. It's been over a year since the interview, and it still lingers in my mind how bad that experience that was. I've been working professionally for over 20 yrs with several major employers. So, I've been through a few rounds of interviews. Microsoft stood out in the worst way. I cringe when I see their commercials. Not sure this is how the senior executives who wants to change the culture of the company wants us to think of Microsoft. I can only hope they treat employees better than candidates.",

Where it went bad was during the final round of interviews onsite at one of their company locations.  Let me preface all the below to add that this was for a role in Sales. \r\n\r\nLet's start off the with good: \r\nHR was receptive\r\nTravel Desk was great\r\nSome of the MS employees I spoke/met with are great people, respectful and very informative\r\nthis is where is ends ...\r\n\r\nOn to the NOT so GREAT :\r\nAfter the initial screen and first (informal) calls if you make the cut you get to interview in the final round... be careful for what you wish for here ...\r\nFinal round  consists of approx 4 people interviewing you for 45min with 15 min breaks between each interview.  You usually start in the morning and it goes on from there..  Halfway thru one of my interviews I was blindsided (left field) by one interviewer asking  me to do a  technical role play that had no bearing on the role ...needless to say I did not do that  well. The icing however on the cake was one interviewer had me waiting for close to 45mins, did not even apologize for being late and proceed to rush thru the interview and then after 15min he had to leave saying he had to be elsewhere  Rude !  This last interview was outlined as a lunch interview with lunch being served (didn't happen) by now after hours of interviewing I was loosing steam and was told on my way out after all was done that there were box lunches if I wanted to grab one on my way out.  \r\nWhile I went into this with high hopes I came away with the feeling that they had already decided to recruit someone from the inside who was also interviewing and that all this was a huge waste of  time. Some of the questions/inquires were asked in a way to try and make you intentionally fail their test.  \r\nThe worst part in all this was the rudeness, self righteousness and disrespect that was shown by some of the interviewers, that overshadowed any of the good people I had met with during this final round. \r\n\r\nIt has been  about 10 days I have not heard back and can safely assume that  I did not get the job.

I accepted but, again, the disorganization of the HR in scheduling my next interview and delays on answering to my emails permitted that the position was already occupied before the interview I should have done referred by a Microsoft manager. Unbelievable. \n\nYesterday they called me again during office hours, I couldn't answer and then emailed me to call them back. When I did it the head of recruitment said something quickly, I didn't understand anything and we were cut off. I tried to call again and she didn't answer. I emailed her, no reply. \n\nIt's simply incredible...",

All the interviewers worked at Microsoft for at least 10 years and were unenthusiastic about their job. The way they talked about their job and presented themselves seems like their career only revolves around Microsoft and they have no plan to go somewhere else. They probably figured their career is stagnant and staying at Microsoft is the safest option. All interviewers didn't ask me about why Microsoft probably because they don't value a candidate's excitement to work at Microsoft. Instead, they asked why I chose computer science as a major. Overall experience was negative because interviewers weren't excited about their job. The reason interviewers worked there was because they needed a job. Even my recruiter didn't seem happy.

    "review": "I originally applied for a PM internship in Jan 2017, had my first on campus interview with a Principal PM.  They gave a full disclaimer saying almost all positions were filled and this could be a early Fall '18 recruiting event. Went well but things didn't click; three weeks later they told me the summer positions were filled but would help me with a sped up full time process. \r\n\r\nThey reached out to me in early Aug '17 asking if I was still interested. Then they got back in early September saying they'd fly me out to Redmond. Had the final round at Redmond in Oct '17. The entire process was very enjoyable, recruiters constantly helping me with the interview scheduling, accommodating my busy school schedule etc. They put me in a fancy hotel in Bellevue Downtown and covered all trip expenses with a generous meal reimbursement, and sight seeing allowance. \r\n\r\nThe first interview on campus was with a recruiter, the standard elevator pitch. Then they scheduled an interview with a Principal PM three weeks later. We spoke about the PM position in general, my understanding, their expectations. Standard resume walk through, situational behavioral questions, my masters thesis and how could it apply to Industry. \r\n\r\nFinal Rounds: Mine was the standard campus recruiting days 80 kids interviewing for SWE/PM roles. They do it in 2 slots, morning and afternoon. Mine was noon on a Friday. We reached at around 11, and all interviewees had lunch on the MSFT campus(paid by them). Then the interview started at 1pm. So, ideally 4 of the interviewees are interviewed mostly by 4 members from a single business group. One Group PM, One Principal PM, One Senior PM, and One  PM I or II. So I'm guessing acceptance is at 25%. 4 switch with the other 4 over a period of 4 hours. MSFT used to do 4 or 5 interviews back in the day, for the sake of brevity I think they do 3-4 now. 4 meaning you'll mostly get it. Each interview lasts 45 mins to an hour, and the interviewers speak amongst themselves, so try not to repeat and ramble same stuff over. \r\n\r\nMy interviews didn't have any coding questions all over, probably because I had a strong technical background or because the other interviewees didn't have a thorough technical background and to have us tested on a bias free ground.  \r\n\r\n1st interview was about my previous internship experience(s) and end to end white boarding of my Product internship project(Roadmap, Strategy, Tech Flow/Stack, Team Issues, Quantifying Results, Outcome & Impact), and touched on one of my SWE experiences. \r\n\r\n2nd Interview was end to end white boarding of my SWE Internship last summer, the bigger picture, (why did i build it, who did it help, explain it to your grandma, impact, value addition etc), Favourite product, what would I fix? One behavioral qn asking how I blew something up or something blew up and who was responsible for it? \r\n\r\n3rd Interview was area of interest, then talk about a startup what problem would i solve, suggest a product, monetize it, build it from scratch, markets? users? tech stack...Was challenging. \r\n\r\n4th Interview was behavioral situational styled interviews and also why prod etc.. Talk abt a time you fought bureaucracy, stood by what u believed, what would u do if devs dont cooperate, your idea or devs idea, rally folks etc.. Also threw in a prod design qn, same like 3rd but not too much of implementation. \r\n\r\nThe Interviews were such a beautiful experience and felt they asked me things I'd really utilize in my job. Very respectful and smart Interviewers who knew what they wanted out of the process, only downside I barely got any time to pick their brains. Probably because I talk a lot. \r\n\r\nPreparation: Cracking the Pm Interview, Glassdoor, Decode and Conquer the PM Interview, Design of Everyday Things(If you have time, or once you get the job), Medium Articles.\r\n\r\nNegotiation: MSFT offers a really sweet package, but asking more never harmed anyone. Use Haseeb Qureshi's medium article on negotiation. One pointer: Don't simply ask for more money, find innovative things to ask or good reasons for more money.",

Call was about 30 minutes and while the interviewer was nice they were short on specifics of the role. A lot of repetition of \"diversity initiatives,\" but little actual detail of what the starting point, and outcomes for the role would be.\n\nNext step was an onsite in Redmond. The odd part, is that while making travel arrangements for the interview through the user portal, the system told me I had not been selected for the job. I mentioned this to the recruiter and they said to ignore that. I had a bad feeling about it. \n\nIn Redmond I met with five people, and they seemed to be the only ones in the office in that group, that day. \n\nThe interviewers had their own private offices and I was walked from one office to the next after each concluded. Each time I entered an office it seemed I was interrupting them, and two didn't bother turning on the light, so we sat and \"talked\" in the dark. \n\nThey were nice, and very practiced interviewers. There was a lot of repetition of the importance of  \"diversity initiatives\" but little on concrete actions in place currently, or what they wanted to do differently. I got the sense it was mostly a buzz term. \n\nConfirming that perception was learning, the group was being lead by a white man who said he didn't think the diversity problem was solvable, because it is a numbers game, and there aren't enough diverse candidates in the pool of talent. My questions are: \"Why not tie compensation of all employees to actions that improve diversifying the pools? How many teach computer science at a high school? How many are involved in student groups at their alma mater? How many offer projects or tutoring to underrepresented groups? Why is this just a buzz term for HR?\"\n\nReward what you want repeated. Tie compensation to action and it will change things. \n\nHowever, as interesting as the diversity challenge is, nobody spoke about the specifics of the role.

    "review": "I couldn't find any interview reviews on glassdoor for the Data Scientist Intern position, so I hope this helps someone!\r\n\r\nI applied online at careers.microsoft.com for a software engineering internship role (I'm 90% sure it was that role), and I got an email for an on-campus interview. They didn't mention which role I'd be interviewing for. This had one typical technical question that you could find in Cracking the Coding Interview, but I think I messed it up and assumed I failed the process.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, I got an email inviting me to the on-site interviews + a dinner at a fancy restaurant the night before. I prepared for questions from CTCI (they didn't mention which team/role I'd be interviewing for, so I assumed it would be software engineering).\r\n\r\nThere were four interviews - all of them had data science questions, and there was maybe one typical CTCI question among all four interviews. The interviews felt like conversations and I felt very comfortable talking to the people (I wasn't sure what their exact positions were and were too scared to ask at that point - they all worked in a data related field but it sounded like software engineering for the most part).\r\n\r\nThankfully, most of the interview questions were things I already knew from prior databases classes + statistics + calculus classes. There was one question I didn't know how to answer about a machine learning algorithm, but I think the interviewer was fine that I didn't know it.\r\n\r\nTips: Ask your recruiter which POSITION you're interviewing for - I asked for about the team instead, and they told me I'd be interviewing with multiple teams (but I meant position). Also, learn the differences between a position (data scientist), team (machine learning studio), and group (Azure, for example).\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm super happy with the outcome - I originally didn't apply to this role because I felt underqualified, but the interviews weren't that bad.",

The final interview was almost entirely technical focused on technology strategy and finance. However, the other interns told me their interviews differed in nature.

I was away at the time and when I returned I had received two messages from the recruiter asking if I would be interested in a role as Customer Success Manager. I replied on my return and he wanted to organise a call immediately. \r\n\r\nWe arranged for a quick call to discuss the role and my experience. When I investigated online I saw that they were looking for a CSM with 4-6 years experience,  I thought this wasn't the role as I myself have only have 18 months experience. \r\n\r\nIt was an easy phone call, the recruiter explained that Microsoft has opened a new office and it was planing on recruiting 700 people over the next six months. I described my current role and he seemed to think I was very suited to the role. The recruiter very much talked up the role (which you would expect from any recruiter) they told me that 25% bonus would be available each quarter and basically guaranteed the bonus. He said the salary could be between 40-50k for the right applicant. He told me he would like to recommend me for the next stage interview, which would involve a phone call with a HR manager, then the next step would be an assessment day. He said he would send over a \"quick questionnaire\" that he wanted me to fill out. \r\n\r\nOnce we got off the phone he sent me the questionnaire, which was a detailed form, that required a lot of research and knowledge of the Microsoft. He asked for me to send it back my close of business, which would not be possible as I have a full time job that he was aware of. \r\n\r\nAlthough at this point I felt it was all seeming a little bit too good, I still filled out the form and spent a lot of time doing so. When I sent it off to him that evening (having stayed up late to complete it) I never heard back. I emailed 2 weeks later to ask for any feedback and once again I have heard nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that my experience level was incorrect, however I think it would have been professional to at least explain this and offer me some feedback. It very much felt like I was a weekly target of a number of applications he needed to have received,  but had no real chance at this role.

All three interviews included some basic behavioral questions (What are you interested in doing at MS? Tell me about some of your projects, etc.), followed by either an abstract coding related problem, or writing code on the whiteboard. No complex data structures, coding questions were fairly straight forward and interviewers were very helpful and talkative throughout.

I heard back four days later that I was scheduled for an onsite, which I had to schedule within three weeks. \r\n\r\nFlights and hotel were booked on my behalf, and I had 5 interviews back to back with a 30 minute lunch break in between (six hours altogether).

He told me not even an hour before my interview WHO would be interviewing me (there's multiple people). He also told me that I failed to fill out paperwork that the company had sent me regarding a non-disclosure agreement. The company NEVER emailed me this DocuSign, and the HR representative ARGUED with me. He finally checked his email and said, \"oh yeah. You're right.\"\r\n\r\nFast forward to the interview itself, they interviewed me for a totally different position. I'm qualitative, not quantitative. This was VERY clear in my resume and CV. I was interviewed by 4 people, and the hiring manager laughed in my face when he asked me advanced quantitative questions that I didn't know the answer to.

We agreed to schedule a phone interview, and after two months of correspondence due to them sending me faulty links for my interview, I finally had my first phone interview with a senior manager on their team. This went fairly smoothly, with a relaxed behavioral start and a more product-focused question in the end.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, another senior manager of the team I'd be working on called me for another interview. This one was a lot more involved, and the manager wasn't exactly the best at asking productive questions towards the goal he was asking me for, but we made it through in the end. This also came as a surprise for me to receive the call that morning due to our agreement of another time later that day, but I rolled with it despite some astute lack of organization on their part.\r\n\r\nThe then called me in for an on-site interview at their HQ in Seattle. It consisted of three back-to-back interviews with a PM and two senior managers. The first went smoothly, and was mainly behavioral. The second consisted of the manager asking me a question about how to design a website for a wedding registry, and then completely ignoring me to watch the youtube livestream of the big eclipse that was happening during our interview and proceeding to answer emails with his back turned to me while I was explaining my thought process. After he had to ask me to repeat myself after his preoccupation with his computer, he very rudely insulted me and my university program for not having experience with some complex data model practices that he was apparently looking for most in our question. After this interview, the final interview with the manager of the team I'd be working with consisted of him presenting me with a compatibility problem they were going through, and despite my best efforts, most ideas I came up with were somewhat shot down or dismissed with a lot of \"We've already tried that\" or \"No this wouldn't work because x\", so the conversation didn't really progress past the first stages of the question unfortunately.",

We quickly arranged my first three meetings with separate individuals on separate days (due to schedules).  After the initial phone interview, all communications were via email.  Ok, that's fine with me, we don't have to actually speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, though I emailed the recruiter before and after EACH of my interviews, I NEVER heard from her again (after the initial phone interview - not even any kind of prep about the interview process, etc, which other competitors provide to all interviewees graciously).  Not the way to treat a \"potential\" employee.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I was interviewing with several companies (competitors) at this level (and I was upfront with Microsoft recruiter and employees about this fact), never getting a response to my polite emails just makes my choice so much easier - - to go with one of your competitors instead of Microsoft.  \r\n\r\nIf this is how you treat someone that you \"want\" to work at your company, makes me really cautious of how you would treat me as an employee!\r\n\r\nGranted there are a lot of people who are dying to work at Microsoft and Microsoft has a plethora of openings (it is a VERY large behemoth) and people to choose from, but I'm lucky in having my choice of companies...and how you treat people is very important to me - not just a motto for you to place on your website.

I interviewed at Bellevue, WA in June 2017. \r\n\r\nAfter a brief chat with the recruiter, she setup a technical phone interview. The question was trivial, but with a twist, making it interesting. The interviewer was helpful and guided me towards a solution. I managed to get a suitable solution which cracked the problem.\r\n\r\nAfter clearing the telephonic round, I was called onsite. Microsoft is huge in Seattle and you may get awestruck by their infrastructure in the area(It was my first time in Seattle as well!). I was scheduled to meet 4 team members. From the interview panel, two people ask core technical whiteboard coding questions while the other two ask design questions.\r\n\r\nMy first interview was with a Senior Software Engineer. He asked me a coding question that is fairly popular on Leetcode/CTCI etc. I managed to reach the solution. The interviewer was impressed. My next interview was with a Senior Engineering Manager. He asked me a design/coding problem which I had seen for the first time.  I managed to reach a respectable solution. Next was the interview with a Software Engineer 2 who was also my lunch buddy. He asked me a design question, I managed to design a Java solution for this. He was happy with it.\r\n\r\nLastly, I was called for the final round. This was the toughest interview of all. I came up with an iterative solution for the problem. It worked well, but then the interviewer asked to come up with a recursive solution with optimized time complexity. I managed to write the recursive solution after taking some time and scratching my head around the problem. But, it is worth mentioning, all the interviewers try to take you towards a solution, they help and guide you. They want the solution to be with good time and space complexities and also ask you to give some test cases for your solution.",

The interviewer was so busy, he didn't seat continuously, he was roaming around and coming back.

Setup a phone interview with 3 different groups and 2 groups wanted to bring me on site for a final interview.\r\n\r\nOn-Site Interview with Group # 1:\r\nHiring manager expressed his desire openly to hire me at the end of an interview and he asked to meet the director (he was not on my interview schedule). It was a clear sign that they will extend me an offer based on hiring manager's feedback. But they disappeared completely after an on-site interview. Recruiter did not even bother to email me saying I am rejected. Totally unprofessional behavior after the interview.\r\n\r\nGroup # 2\r\nHiring manager was totally unprofessional. After each interview with his team members, he asked me to wait outside conference room and checked with the interviewer how I performed. One of the interviewer did not even book a conference room for an interview, instead he walked me over their entire building to find a break room where we can sit and discuss. Eventually he found an open floor white board where tons of ppl walk by every minute and he asked me to write a code on that white board while other ppl walking by looking at what I am doing. Really? I work in Fortune 100 company but never seen this type of unprofessional interview. I totally hate the hiring manager and the group, so I was not expecting to get a positive response from this group.\r\n\r\nOverall Microsoft has a tendency  to interview tons of ppl but that does not necessarily mean they are actively looking to hire someone right away. So don't go with a feeling that you will get an offer if you are prepared. I think I did exceptionally well with Group # 1 (technically, behavior, leadership and management discussions) but they disappeared completely.\r\n\r\nI had a totally unprofessional on-site interview experience.",

Personally I had 5 question for each category (Technical Questions, Questions about working in Microsoft, Questions about life at microsoft).\r\n- Be enthusiastic, dynamic and smiling\r\n- Don't overthink technical interviews, they are pretty cool and can help you if you have some problems. If you have the minimum level required you can't fail it if you know how to build on their indications.",

Call from a recruiter that finds you a fit, phone interview to screen you, one on one with the hiring manager if you are a high level candidate, then to the interview rounds.  Do not be fooled by the \"final rounds\" interviews.  This is just one day that all candidates are brought in to interview at one time.  While you have been the \"finalists\" chosen, there is probably a 50% chance they have already chosen an internal Microsoft candidate to fill the role and they just need to fulfill their EEOC requirements.  That is my honest opinion.  \r\nThey begged me to hold off an offer from another competitor company which I did while they are aligning up the team that would be interviewing.  \r\nThe day of the final rounds was nothing short of impressive.  \r\nSign in, go to your room and managers come to you one at a time for hour long interviews.  Exhausting day, Overall, expect 7-10 meetings from the Recruiter to the final rounds to get an offer.  \r\nMy other job offer that is now frozen in an internal reorg right now.  \r\nMicrosoft chose internal candidate which I realized was the case when I met for my final round day.  \r\nTone was 100% different than on the phone when he was literally begging me to come in. \r\n\r\n2.  The other problem with Microsoft is that if you have one final round of interviews for one job and they refer you as a great Microsoft employee the other recruiters and HMs can see your interviewers comments from your day there which can negatively impact the next position you apply for.  \r\n\r\nI'd say overall Microsoft is lower level than most competitors I've worked for.  \r\nNot polished or impressive overall in my opinion.  \r\nNicest people in the world that you would definitely want to work with, but I'd say be weary of applying for jobs at Microsoft, you have a 10% chance of getting an offer unless you're already there OR unless you have a big hookup, which I actually had but decided I wanted to get the job on my own, which didn't happen.  \r\nWhat the interviewing panel did not know is that I personally know the Executive who could've made one phone call to get me the job.  Instead I went after this putting my trust in the managers promises.\r\nIn the end, I lost out on my job offer in hand (which may get unfrozen) and the job with Microsoft which would have been my number one choice.  \r\n\r\nBoth jobs had terrible patches to sell in or issues that were nearly insurmountable, but I was willing to give it a shot.  \r\nOverall despite my comments I would say this is a very positive interview process with the recruiters, schedulers and managers who show up prepared on the final rounds day.  \r\nBut Microsoft is definitely not forthcoming with visibility into an internal candidate already basically who has the job and the 80 hours you put into preparing technically for these discussions.  \r\nDisappointing, unprofessional and a complete waste of time.",

I accepted as a rejection myself due to lack of communication from HR which is very unofficial.\n\nThe reason for the rejection is not the technical interview instead the people I knew from past currently working with Microsoft most probably didn't share good reviews about me which should not be the case.\n\nI prefer not be interviewed by Indians rather interviews should be taken by people outside India in order to prevent such happenings.",

    "review": "It was a pretty long interviewing process. It took from around march until the beginning of may. \r\nIt consisted of several parts:\r\n1) I applied through their platform, Yello for this job. After about 2 days they answered on e-mail with an invitation for an online test.\r\n2) The online test. Situational judgement. You were given the role of someone inside a company, there was a situation and you had to order 5 given answers from most to less likely. You have no time limit. It's pretty easy. It took about 3 more days to answer with an invitation to next phase.\r\n3) A recorded video interview. I must say that other colleagues of mine who applied for the same job were sent directly to phase 4. The recorded video interview was not that easy. It takes some time to set up the gear you have for the interview and to test it. When you begin the interview you have a total of 8 question. The first was a \"warm up\" about what you like to do,  the 6 questions similar to the ones in the online test only that you had to answer with your own words and what you would really do. The last one was about what technology improvements excites you the most. Nothing too technical. The hard part is that you are given 30 seconds to read the question and prepare your answer and the 2 minutes to answer. The main thing is not to get panicked, to stay calm and smile. After that it took about 1 week for them to answer and invite me to next phase. I also sent them an e-mail asking about the status of my application.\r\n4) The Skype interview. The great thing about it is that you get schedule it when it's best for you. The Skype interview was great. The assessor was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. It was more like a dialog which I really enjoyed. The questions are general, about you, the job and Microsoft, what expectations you have, then the last one was about new technologies (just as the one at the recorded interview). It took about 20 minutes. After a week I received the invitation to the final assessment center. \r\n5) The assessment center. We were called at the Microsoft Office and spent a whole day there. There were 5 stages: \r\n- a presentation (10 minutes limit -  something we had to prepare at home for about 2-3 days before)\r\n- a group exercise ( Team of 6 random people - 20 minutes time limit - given task.)\r\n- 2 Soft Skills interviews (with 2 different assessors - Most questions are about you, how would you react in different situations. What matters the most is to be yourself and describe how would you really act. Honesty is at price here.)\r\n- Technical interview (Here is not about how much you know, it's about how you think. You can't \"prepare\" for it. It only requires very basic knowledge about technology.)\r\nI really thought  that I screwed up the Assessment Center, especially the 2 soft skills interviews and the group exercise because my group was really bad but after three weeks after that I was called and informed that I was selected for the Internship. :D",

I kept on reaching out and finally they interviewed me in Atlanta. I had interviews with five people. Two of the interviewers were women and other three were men. First woman, she said she did not know anything about Microsoft till she met Microsoft's team at National Black. She did not know basic stuff about Microsoft such as Microsoft has no sales model when she was interviewing me. She was busy checking out my LinkedIn and asking about various LinkedIn contacts during the interview. Then, the next woman who interviewed me said \"I am just trying to figure out who gave you an interview. You don't have sales experience. Who is the HR? I am sorry. I didn't mean it that way.\" I kept on getting insulted. Three men who interviewed me were nice. \r\nI am disappointed with the fact that these women lacked knowledge even though it is their job and they were rude. They did not even know they didn't have sales model. I was asking everyone because none of them knew what was going on. Finally, a sales director explained how Microsoft does not have a training program or sales model. \r\n\r\nA lot of people at my school went through same horrible process. Microsoft has a reputation at my school that it is one of the worst places to work at. I am an MBA student from one of the top 15 schools.",

After this, they will call you and schedule a formal job interview on premises. Once you are there, the real fun begins. \r\n\r\nYou will go through 4 job interviews in a single day! This might sound daunting and possibly tiring, but don't worry, they are relatively short and they will most likely ask you the same questions, but don't be to confident, each interviewer is measuring different aspects. \r\n\r\nThat would be it. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

Just answer truthfully and remember that Microsoft is looking for team players.\r\n2. Webcam interview. You have to answer ten pre-recorded questions. After each question, you're given 30 seconds to think about the answer, and then two minutes (max) to record it. By far the most uncomfortable part of the process, since you're talking to a computer.\r\n3. Skype interview. A conversation of roughly 30 minutes with an interviewer, in my case from Dublin. Be sure you know what Microsoft does and what its strategy is. Also, be prepared to answer personal questions (regarding your experience and personality).\r\n4. Assessment Centre. Consists of an individual presentation assignment (which you have to prepare in advance), a group case assignment (which you cannot prepare) and three interviews with different managers. Since the interview questions are the same for each candidate, they are not very personal (e.g. you will not be asked in detail about your professional experience). They are more of the kind \"how would you handle in theoretical situation X?\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the process was very pleasant. All recruiters/managers are kind and genuinely interested in you. They are not trying to trick you with impossible questions, like you sometimes see with other big tech organizations.\r\n\r\nA general note: the interview process is really geared toward your personality. Detailed knowledge of Microsoft's products is rarely tested and not really necessary. So don't spend long amounts of time on becoming a \"Microsoft expert\" (like I did), because that might leave you feeling a little underwhelmed. Rather focus on the organization itself and your personal profile.",

No coding questions were asked but had a great conversation on network management, latency and my work in general. Was scheduled for an onsite interview after 2 weeks. Had a short phone call with the recruiter the day before the interview on what to expect during the day. I was told that 3 rounds of 1:1 interviews were scheduled with a potential for that to be extended to two more rounds. Was specifically told that more than 3 interviews is considered a good sign. The recruiter also promised to get back within 48 hours with the result.\r\nFirst round of interviews was with a principal engineer. He let me use his development system to code. Along with the main coding question, was given two additional code snippets to find bugs/issues. All three problems were not overly had but had plenty of areas which lead to software design discussions. The next was a lunch interview with was very pleasant. Had an opportunity to talk about both work and life in Seattle. The last 30 mins were dedicated to a system design/requirements gathering question and was also asked to pseudo code the algorithm at the end. Third round was with the hiring manager. Was asked to go deep into a mutual exclusion problem that i had coded around 5 years ago. I had forgotten a lot of finer details of it and was finding it hard to recollect. He let that pass and asked me a coding question that  i was able to code. The 4th round was with one of his peers. The hour was mostly spend on OS fundamentals with a coding problem at the end.\r\nHad a good experience overall and i was happy with my performance. Waited 3 days for the recruiter to let me know the result but all i got was radio silence. Had to convince myself that i didn't make it after waiting for a week. I guess their hiring standards are really high. One advice for other folks is to brush up on their past work to as much detail as possible. I felt i had missed out on the interview with the Hiring manager where i couldn't go deep into my past work. Another helpful tip is to ask as many clarifying questions as possible to their coding problems. Every one in the interview including the Hiring manager are able to device a problem on the spot and leave the details to us. It really helps to nail down the details before staring to code. Also beware that they can stop you at any time and pose a specific assumption for the problem that makes you change your approach and re-think all over again.",

There is a group call explaining the day a week ahead of time, going into lots of detail, very helpful. The interview day itself was a half day, three slots of 45 minutes with various senior developers. You and some of the other candidates on that half day always reconvene in a meeting room with various snacks and drinks, and are encouraged to have a friendly chat. There's no pressure here, the recruiter (who follows you along the entire process, even after hiring) insists that they do not have numbers to fill and will select any candidate that is a match. This ended up being incredibly nice and was a chance to discover the different backgrounds of people in the field.\r\n\r\nThe interviews themselves follow a different form depending on offices. Interviewers have a great liberty to do what they feel is necessary to get to know you. I'd recommend the usual (and they will too): Do some hackerrank questions, practice on a whiteboard, read some algorithm design books and brush up on your data structures and software engineering practices.\r\n\r\nThe programming questions themselves weren't particularly difficult, but generally had less than 15 minutes after the long talk to figure them out. What's important here are edge cases, reasoning how you spot things going wrong in what you wrote. Perfect code with all edge cases not expected, but you are expected to spot these problems once you think you are done.",

About 2 months after I was notified I was selected for an onsite interview at Las Colinas, TX. There were about 50 of us in the afternoon session ( another 50 in the morning session). The flight, hotel and all travel expenses were covered by Microsoft. I was individually interviewed by 4 Microsofties, from SEEs to managers. Most of the questions were behavioral, such as tell me about this project you've completed, tell me about yourself, why Microsoft, etc. I had to do several role-plays, such as handling a frustrated customer who doesn't want to talk to me or an angry customer who demands reimbursement, etc. I was asked to explain a segment of code in C++ ( because I listed it on my resume) and explain which hardware component in a computer is most brittle. Some other interviewees also were asked questions like guess a number from 1-20, what would you do if tomorrow is the end of the world, etc, but I weren't asked such questions. Make sure you ask the interviewers questions too!\r\n4. Got a phone call the day after the interview and I was told that I was extended an offer. I am so happy and excited to join the team soon!!!",

The panel seemed less interested and wanted to go through my  presentation that I created for portfolio presentation in 15 min. They dint even go through the design challenge or asked me to present it.\r\n2. Same day I had two one on one rounds with the leads of different departments who were also present during the first presenation round.\r\n\r\na. The manager asked me to do a quick design challenge in 15 mins based on the problems currently they are facing.\r\n\r\nb. The second one on one was a bit different and the manager wanted  me  to  design a solution for another design challenge in 15 min without providing any information about the needs and was told to assume everything. He was expecting me to create a detailed rough sketches on paper showing the interaction and behaviour. \r\n\r\nI am not against the design challenges but it needs to be practical and feasible. They asked me to solve a design problem in 15 mins which they are familiar of. For me thinking in 15 mins and presenting a solution in itself is difficult but still I tried and tried to get as many answers as possible and present a solution. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I want to suggest them is that design is subjective and every one has a different openion and perspective. Judging someone's creativity in 15 mins  with a closed mindset won't give them good designers.\r\n\r\nTo judge my ability there was a design challenge that I submitted before bringing me on site and the emphasis should have been more on the design challenge rather asking me to go through another challenge.",

    "review": "After handing in a CV to a university recruiter, I got an email arranging a short technical interview over Skype/phone. One basic enough coding problem with an engineer and some followup questions about the solution. It only took about 40 minutes and the guy interviewing was friendly so it all went smoothly.\r\n\r\nOnce that was passed, I got a final stage interview on-site. They bring people in in groups of 4. There's a group of 4 Microsoft engineers doing the interviews. Each engineer pairs off with one student and gives them a 45 minute interview. At the end, they rotate so every student gets another interview with a different one of the engineers. Depending on how you're doing, you get 3 or 4 interviews in total. If they can make a decision after 3, they won't bother doing a fourth, but I did 4 and I think everyone else in the group I was with did too. There are also short 5-10 minute breaks between interviews where you get snacks and drinks and you can ask questions to the HR person organising the interviews, as well as just get filled in about details and perks of the job. Overall, it took between 3 and 4 hours. Wearing a suit was not required and nobody on the day did wear one.\r\n\r\nThe interviews questions themselves are actually not that difficult and don't require an extensive knowledge of theory or language libraries or computer architecture or anything like that. They're often happy to let you make up a function to explain your problem more quickly and they aren't really interested in you getting the syntax just right. The questions are generally just algorithms that you can solve with pseudocode. There was no soft interview with fluff questions, apart from some casual small-talk, only these technical ones. Questions were answered on a whiteboard.\r\n\r\nI was unfortunately not offered a position. Although I didn't get feedback as it's against company policy to provide it, I feel pretty sure I know how I messed up. My advice for others to not make the same mistakes as me would be that although they want you to talk about what you're doing and to ask questions, do not ask questions related to what they think of your solution before it's even finished. The questions you should ask should only be related to clarifying what the question requires and figuring out what boundaries you're working within. \r\n\r\nShow confidence in your own ability to solve it, even if you aren't 100% sure you're doing the right thing or if you feel it's a convoluted solution, instead of looking for validation from the interviewer that you're on the right track by regularly asking \"does that seem alright?\" or similar things along the way. Don't ask for feedback on the solution until it's done and DO NOT present it as being done until you feel you have tested it properly by yourself. If there is a flaw in the solution, that's fine as long as you find it yourself instead of letting them point it out. I was most of the way through my third interview before realising I was doing this because the interviewer had the honesty to point it out and offer me this advice, but by then I had already gone through nearly three while doing it.\r\n\r\nFor most of the process, I was pretty happy and would have been inclined to say that despite not getting the job, it was a positive experience if it didn't become a bit soured at the end. As someone still very eager to work there and reapply, I was really hoping to discuss this with the recruiter, but communication was unfortunately very unresponsive after the interview.",

After moving on through the phone screening, I went to the onsite interview. This was a 3 day process in January. The first and last days were allotted for travel, and the second day was mainly for the interview. The 3-day trip to Seattle was a very fun experience, but being at Microsoft for one day was not.\r\n\r\nThe onsite interview was an extremely grueling process; both the candidate and the interviewers were completely drained by the end. 4 interviews total, at about 45 minutes each with a 10 minute break in between each one. After these interviews, a decision will be made about your offer in two weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter having gone through many interviews for technical roles, I found Microsoft's process to be needing the most improvement. The employees interviewing seemed as though they disliked the job via their demeanor and and answers to questions posed about work-life balance, as well as the average hours a Microsoft employee will work per week. Furthermore, Microsoft did not offer much in terms of \"selling\" their company to a future employee, as compared to other company's candidacy process. No tour throughout the campus, no Microsoft gear to take home, and no real connections to any of the current employees. \r\n\r\nOverall, this process made it seem like Microsoft was a very demanding corporation that did not offer much for employees with a life outside of work, but the trip to Seattle was a fun experience.",

The biggest challenge with this interview is that it was not focused on the role itself, it was more about my past and future rather than what it took to perform in the current opportunity, which was not well described verbally nor did the interview really focus on the written job description.",

    "review": "Started with a phone interview, which was pretty standard for a screening interview. I was then scheduled for 3 skype interviews in succession for 30 minutes each. Each interview was with a different person within the Fargo branch. The interview process went very well and I received an offer. My negative experience was associated with the background check. They use an outside organization called TrueScreen to compile their background checks for them. They proved to be very unaccommodating to the schedule of a busy college student. The questions on the background check were very unclear and caused issues in the process, which led to many phone calls and emails for clarifying information and additional paperwork, such as W-2's. Apparently, they had called my former places of work and were unable to get in contact with a few of my former bosses. However, when I called my bosses to see what happened, they said they had never received a call in the first place. This all led to negative areas on my background check, which the Microsoft background check review team rejected. They then rescinded my offer. Learn from my experience and be very thorough and detailed on your background check. They are extremely unforgiving and expect every detail to be perfect. Do not delay them in their process either. When they call, drop everything you are doing and answer right away. It was very clear that they did not like to wait and expected you to put down everything you were doing, no matter how important, to answer their questions. I would often be at class and work and couldn't answer right away, and they would call 3 times in a 3-hour span. If you make them wait too long, they will view you as a nuisance and will be unforgiving when compiling your report. They are extremely detail oriented to the point of absurdity. Treat it like another interview. You still have to be on top of your game. All in all, I had a very poor background check experience. Although I had an offer and was qualified for the job and had nothing on my background check beside 2 petty misdemeanors (the legal equivalent of a traffic ticket) they rescinded my offer. I had talked to my recruiter before the background check process to see her opinion on if the petty misdemeanors would affect my chances, and she told me that the charges I had were common and had not hindered other candidates from being hired. Learn from my mistakes and realize these guys aren't messing around. You're just a name on a page to them, so don't give them a reason to not like you. I must clarify my interview was great and was conducted wonderfully. My only complaint is with TrueScreen.",

This was a brief, 30-minute interview, which consisted of a few behavioral questions and one coding question on the whiteboard. It was a relatively simple question about sorting characters in an array. Overall, it wasn't too difficult, but I flubbed the whiteboard question. Fortunately, I realized my mistake and told it to my interviewer (this was when most of the interview time was up, so there was no time to correct it on the board).\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, I heard that I had passed the first round, but PM internships for that summer were full. My recruiter encouraged me to contact her the following Fall, when I was interviewing for full-time roles. I did, and I went straight to final rounds in Redmond that Fall. \r\n\r\nMy onsite was one of the \"interview circuit\" days, where 70-80 people (all interviewing for different roles) were interviewed at the same time. Most people had 3-4 interviews. It was hectic and nervewracking, but Microsoft took care of all the logistics, and all of the interviewers were very energetic, friendly, and conversational. In fact, I can easily say this was the most fun day of onsite interviews I've ever had. All of my questions for onsites were behavioral / experience and design questions, which was slightly surprising. I expected a coding question or two.\r\n\r\nJust before lunch, a recruiter pulled me aside and asked if I was available for a fifth interview. (Make sure you clear your schedule for the whole day for an onsite.) This last one was with a Group Program Manager at Microsoft, and just like the other interviewers, he was friendly, energetic, and conversational. He asked a few experience and behavioral questions, and we ended the day with an interesting design question.\r\n\r\nI interviewed on a Friday, and on the following Tuesday I got a phone call from my recruiter, saying that I would receive an offer!\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a wonderful, challenging, and fun experience. There was a lot of dead time when my recruiter was waiting to hear back from various departments to schedule a phone screen, hear back from the interviewers from phone screen, submit me for final rounds, schedule final rounds, get airfare for final rounds, etc. Aside from all the waiting, the interview process was extremely smooth, and really, genuinely fun.",

I was a given a case study two weeks prior to the interview day and was told to present it in front the interviewer. It was a very casual presentation. Later, I was asked behavioural, competency, opinion and experience verification questions. I interviewed through Skype one week later with one of the interviewers.",

The next morning I got invited for an onsite interview and I was scheduled to fly to Redmond in about 3 weeks, all the travel logistics were scheduled by Microsoft very efficiently. I prepared for these interviews very well (so I thought) by reading hundreds of blogs, doing more research on the products, coming up with questions, what to wear (don\u2019t wear suit! Business casual is better) and everything you can imagine about interview preparation for your dream job. \r\n\r\nI flew the night before and got ready for my 3 scheduled interviews (I was emailed the list of interviewers the night before). The three interviews including lunch went well enough apparently and I was added two more, which according to the internet is a great sign. I completed the full loop and was sent home after 5 interviews and 1 conversation with HR, I felt pretty confident at the end of the day. Flew back home and this is where it got frustrated.\r\n\r\nSome people hear about the interview outcome the very next day, I initially sent out an email about two weeks after the onsite and was told to wait, so I did, for 4 months and got rejected in the end. The whole process took half a year to get a pass so it is hard to not feel disappointed.

The decision process was opaque. The recruiters had said multiple times that we (the candidates) were \"competing against ourselves\" and that there was a spot for everyone there. This seems untrue, for many reasons but especially because it took so long to get feedback. Maybe I shouldn't have taken that claim at face value, but I would argue that it shouldn't be said if it's not the case. There could have been another reason, but my recruiter didn't look into it.

Here ya go, (for me this was a new store opening)\r\n1. I applied through Glassdoor and a week later a HR gives me a calls and we have a simple phone interview. Questions include, \"how many hours do you want to work?\" \"Why Microsoft\" and etc... Very easy.\r\n2. You're going to receive an email about a group interview that you must attend. The group interview is like a selection test, the management will choose the best candidates for the job and offer them a call back for a 3rd 1v1 interview. How do you make yourself stand out? BE ENERGETIC AND FULL OF LIFE. Microsoft really wants people that can talk loudly and inspire others, so don't be afraid to yell random things for fun! The whole group interview lasts about 2 hours and its filled with fun games like, introduce your partner to the whole group and also provides a presentation about Microsoft's history and benefits. NOTE: You don't have to be super tech smart. Im a tech guy and I'm in school for computer science, but i was able to show my wild and energetic side. My friend, who knows WAY more about tech than me, didn't get hired. Also, for heavens sake, PLEASE answer all of the questions the management have because they want you to actively participate. Don't be afraid to asks question either.\r\n3. SUPER IMPORTANT PART; READ CAREFULLY.\r\n I received an email from one of the managers for my 1v1 interview. I walked in to a hotel and we interviewed in a hotel room and they even provided water, it was a very comfortable setting. You will interview with two Assist Managers (at the same time). I will write the interview questions below. Okay, SUPER IMPORTANT PART. SO, i guess there is a \"SECRET\" interview with the store manager, which will only be given if you really are chosen for the job. Basically at the end of my interview with the two Assist Managers, they asked me if i wanted to stay and talk to the store managers. One of the other candidates told me she heard a rumor stating, \"if you're offered the final interview, you're most likely getting the job\" However, I could be wrong!\r\n4. 2 weeks later i got a call back for the job. yaaaaay.",

I must have done well on this interview since I was invited out to Washington for on-campus interviews.\r\n\r\nThe night before the interviews we all went for a fancy dinner at this sushi place and got to meet each other. That was kinda cool, I got to hear about other people's backgrounds and stories.\r\n\r\nWe were all being interviewed for a focus called Customer Facing Technologist which has 4 different roles that vary by how technical or how people facing you are. To be clear, Customer in these roles meant corporate clients. The positions included Technical Account Manager, Associate Consultant, Field Engineer, and Project Manager.  The weird things is that nobody knew which specific position we we're all being hired for, everything was kept super vague which messed with our ability to prepare for the interviews.\r\n\r\nThe next day we each had two rounds of interviews. We were told that we'd have a 2-on-1 interview where we had to present on any topic we were passionate about to two Microsoft staff, and then a second 1-on-1 interview. My second interview however, ended up being another 2-on-1. Both interviews went well, the first pair asked me questions related to my presentation. On the other hand, the second was more technical, and since I made it pretty clear that I didn't want to get my hands in the code - leaning more toward the Technical Account Manager position - I was asked hypothetical questions related to managing accounts. With these questions it seemed they were looking for very specific answers/solutions and I was drilled until i mentioned the right word or phrase. \r\n\r\nAfter the interviews, we were given cool Microsoft hoodies, and free Taxi-ride vouchers. We all felt pretty good about the whole experience. We were put up in nice hotels and given a generous meal reimbursement credit of $75 per day. The interviewers were all very nice, and did a great job of making us feel welcome and comfortable.\r\n\r\nI ultimately was not given an offer, but I wasn't torn up by it since I actually applied for a design position; Not sure how I got fit into the Customer Facing Technologist bunch but during the interview, especially reviewing my resume, the interview seemed to give off a sense that I would be bored at the job and not using my real skillset.",

They had a dozen tech questions related to my area of expertise.  Very basic questions overall but details that you might not think about on a daily basis.  Think of Technet documentation on minimum specs, etc.  This interview also covered my current salary (which was required to proceed with the interview) and made sure I was OK with travelling.\r\n\r\nNext, I was interviewed by two senior level PFEs over Skype.  They were extremely knowledgeable but were very friendly at the same time.  This interview was probably the toughest interview I've ever had.  Their job is basically to drill down to the level where you have to say \"I don't know\".  I was able to answer most questions, and they skipped an entire major component of the product I work with because I was able to answer everything to their satisfaction.  Instead, they chose to focus on my weaker areas and kept pressing until I had to tell them I was unsure of the answer.  Apparently this is totally fine and they aren't expecting perfect answers.  They simply want to make sure you understand the product to the level they expect and didn't just go out and memorize the tech answers for the first interview.\r\n\r\nThe last interview was more like a conversation than an interview.  I traveled on-site and met with a director and the hiring manager.  They were very laid back and mostly just talked about my goals, what the job was like, where I saw myself in 5 years, what working for Microsoft is like, etc.  They did have a few basic questions but nothing difficult.  I was very impressed with how personal they were.  They came off as friendly and laid back.  They gave me plenty of time to ask questions as well.  I heard back within a day or two with the offer.",

He asked me about a project and asked questions, especially on model validation, choice of evaluation metrics and how I worked with the business to define the scope. This was quite untypical for phone screening where you usually get tested on SQL and basic probability questions.\r\nI was then invited onsite for a round of interviews. This is where my experience becomes really two experiences in one. The HR portion of it was horrible. Interview rooms were not booked or double booked, and the people I was interviewing with had also been double booked with other candidates. It was very awkward to show up in a room and find another candidate in it.\r\nAside from that, all the interviewers were nice and had good questions. Most questions were focused on machine learning, and most of the questions were extremely similar across interviewers. Nobody asked me to code a single line of code, and almost everybody asked me how to deal with a categorical variable with high cardinality.\r\nAt the end I found the interview process easy, almost easy to a point it raised a red flag (if you hire someone based on this process, what's the risk I'll have to work with not qualified people?).\r\nAfter a week of silence my recruiter reached out with good news. He was very robotic and essentially threw at my the compensation package assuming that I had no option but accept it. No fuss at all, no feedback asked, no asking me if I had questions.\r\nA year earlier I had experienced a Google interview process, and while I was not offered a position in that case, the recruiter had been 100 times more personable in turning me down than the Microsoft recruiter had been in extending an offer.\r\nI give thumbs up to the Microsoft team and their people, and thumbs down to their HR.",

I showed 3 works and in depth talking about the problems, my design process and the challengers I faced and how I overcame them and the results of the project. At the end people we ask questions and mainly for clarifications. I made sure I put effort into the look of my presentation and added some personal touches to it such as photos and talked a bit about myself so they can relate to me.\r\n\r\nThe design challenge I thought was strange. They gave me a sheet or requirements and they stressed they were looking at how \"creative\" I was. Keyword here. I couldn't really ask questions before hand regarding the challenge because it took me a while to read (1 page) and left me alone for 60 mins so you have to state your assumptions and make your case clear and walk through your design. I was asked to design a calendar with XYZ requirements. After 60 mins they (I had about 5-6 ppl) will come in and ask a lot of questions and a  lot of \"what ifs\".  Unfortunately I know my solution wasn't as \"creative\" as they would've wanted because it isn't the way I solve problems (especially in a vacuum with no collaboration and under pressure). They really wanted someone who was innovative even though I knew the role I applied for required someone who could balance all the requirements which I believe I did according to the sheet. I really enjoyed our discussion and bantering afterwards and made me solve the problem in a different way but in reality I know I wouldn't have solved it that way because I like designing things that I know is shippable and maintainable in the long term while achieving business, technical and user goals. It really helps being collaborative (if they had allowed it in the beginning..). If you're an out of the box thinking you may do well. They wanted to see more breath than depth and more conceptual ideas than actually getting the job done (which I am better at). \r\n\r\nAfter that I had lunch with the hiring manager, he was really digging into why Microsoft and why this team, why did you leave your last company etc. and asking really tough questions. He really wanted to extract as much red flags as he could from me. I felt like I was being set up for failure during that interview. I could tell he already didn't feel I was a good fit and was looking for not design skills but more of the soft skills of dealing with difficult people and influencing them.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch I was told I wasn't senior enough for the role but I should try other roles and that was the end of my interview loops.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole interview process, they were very nice and clear to me what they wanted to see and really wanted me to succeed and was very obvious what answers they wanted out from me, unfortunately I didn't go that route because I also wanted to make sure I wasn't saying things just to please them in order to get the job, I chose to respond as honestly as I could because I also wanted to make sure Microsoft and the team was a good fit for me. \r\n\r\nAt the end I believe Microsoft wasn't a good fit for me and this has been a positive experience.",

Of course I said yes! \r\nThe questions themselves were basic - it was a fit interview with questions like walk me through your CV, tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult client, etc. The part I found disappointing was what seemed to be complete disinterest from my interviewer. She phoned me late and left the call early. She didn't know the answers to my questions, and typed extremely loudly during the entire interview, making it difficult to concentrate. I tried to engage in normal conversation while speaking with her, but she didn't seem interested at all, and didn't say much at all besides asking the questions. She didn't even introduce herself, not even her name (which I learned from Skype) until I asked about her background at the end! Overall, it was an uncomfortable experience for me, when I had read that Microsoft first interviews tend to be very conversational and more of a get-to-know-you interview. Even more frustrating was that the interview was with someone I'd never met, in Seattle, by phone (but not video), when I'd been in contact for many months with a recruiter from my area, in the region in which I would have actually liked to have the job. It was unfortunate and disappointing, but I guess some things like this are luck-based and vary greatly depending on the recruiter and their mood that day.",

    "review": "I am posting and rating this interview experience as negative only because of one person(Sr SDE) that was involved in the process, I will get back to her behavior later. First thing first,Hiring manager and product manager were really nice persons, they were very professional. My first interview was with product manager, which went for 45 min and I was asked some ethical, behavioral and product related questions. My 2nd interview was a technical loop with Sr SDE, about which I will discuss later in a separate paragraph. My 3rd interview was with Hiring manager, which lasted beyond time limit of 60 min, I was asked some tough questions but we both were enjoying conversation and he seemed impressed with my talk and experience. After the interview I was told by hiring manager that he will take hiring decision by eod tom only as he will meet everyone today evening or tom morning. After the interview I had the gut feeling that I nailed it, as I aced all 3 interviews. Though I can't comment on how my answers to behavioral and ethical questions were taken, but for some questions,I was told on the spot by product manager that what I answered was a correct answer and this was to test core values. My only concern was technical interview even though I nailed every question asked, because of behavior and conduct of interviewer, now lets jump to what happened in technical round.\r\n\r\nI was introduced to Sr SDE( who was a tester for most of her career at MS, I think she was made SDE because of last year's changes in MS) by Product Manager. It was supposed to be a lunch interview for about 90 min, with lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 and from 12:30 to 1:30 continue interview in conference room. I greeted this lady but I was not given any response. She ignored the schedule and directly took me to conference room for interview. She didn't had copy of my Resume, I had 4/5 copies of my resume with me, so I shared one with her. She asked me a TSQL question on white board, which I resolved in like 5 sec, she then got surprised and tried to made it complicated, I resolved that too quickly, then she asked me what if each of these intervals are dynamic in nature, I resolved that too, she told me it will not work, I told her lets test to check and it worked. She accepted that it will work. Then she asked me ranking function related TSQL question, which again I resolved in 10 sec, she then asked me how you will test it. I told her about 7/8 test cases and how you can write all these in VS DB unit testing project. My resume has lot of other stuff like Big data, Machine learning, Python, Java and data science. It was very clear that she didn't had any experience with any of these as she completely ignored asking any question related to these. She then asked me how you will predict sales amount for our product, which is very open ended question, I talked about it for like 10 min(discussed different feature selection, model selection and validation tech and challenges around curse of dimensionality and how to take care of it) and it became clear that she didn't understood what I am talking and also she didn't asked me a single follow up question. Only question she asked me, how much out of these I have implemented. With her facial expression and postures I became  sure that she didn't came prepared for interview and she also don't know much about ML/data science/Datawarehouse/Big Data/MPP and analytical technologies, for which she was supposed to interview me. She then asked me do you know .NET(not listed on my resume). I said no I don't , but then she replied, oh you know Java( I said yes as it was on my resume, expecting some follow up algorithm question or oop question), but she didn't asked me any question related to algorithm or OOP. She then ended interview asking if I have any questions. After the interview she took me to lunch area in Microsoft and though it was a lunch interview sponsored by MS, I PAID FROM MY POCKET FOR THE LUNCH as she pointed me to pay! After that she just wanted to leave me unattended(Though my MS issued ID said, I should be escorted all times for security reasons), I asked her can I sit in the conference room till start of my next interview, she replied yes and then she asked me to walk myself to hiring manager room after 15 min and she left me unescorted for next 15 min. I greeted her before she left, she didn't replied back and just left.  Only idea I got at the end of this interview with her was that she didn't liked me at all from the very go. Later it took me 5 min to search for hiring manager room.\r\n\r\nThough I am none to comment on the competencies and professional behavior of any individual. But this is the last thing I was expecting from a Microsoft Senior Software Developer. I would definitely like Microsoft HR to look into this issue.",

The MACH program deals with recently out of school undegrads with the age of <30; The perks of this program is that you gain more exposure to management and you get to travel in the first year for 2-3 times to attend various sets of trainings. \r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that you start with one of the lowest levels and as a consequence your salary is one of the lowest too(compared to others in the company). \r\n\r\nThe interview itself was a bit shady at first with me applying for England but then being called on my Romanian number from a british land line, man on the phone asked which country I'm in and if I'm willing to attend an interview with Microsoft. The tricky bit was after we got told what the job offer was about, we had the interview, we've been accepted but we go for an internship not for the actual job; then some of us continued right after with the job being offered; others like me were offered the promised job 4 months after the internship was done with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI said sure and we carried on one week later with a brief interview with a HR lady from Poland via Skype. Few weeks later the real interview came in. I met about 30 + other people that day all coming in for the same interview. The lead of the of MACH program back then came in and introduced herself, talked a little more about the program and the interview stages we will go through. \r\n\r\nApparently this was a big event and managers from all over Europe would come in to meet the new potential candidates. I've been told before by a former peer to remember the current Microsoft slogan \"Empower every company and organization to achieve more!\" and it came in handy. During stage 1, we were paired on with one of the other candidates and in this formation we would circle around a room to talk to pairs of managers. \r\nThis was a more of a language / argumentative get to know each other type of talks which lasted for about 5 minutes with each pair of managers.  Think they mainly wanted to see the language skills, interest and some knowledge about the technology they were representing. \r\n\r\nStage 2 of the interview process was in regards to a social situation in which the entire group of candidates was split into 2. In our group each member was assigned or got to chose a role based. Some information was provided in terms of fragments of data, sheets of paper and then we were faced with a social situation based on the learned information. \r\n\r\nThe situation challenged our decision making processes and after each of our answers the situation got increasingly complex and sensitive, time-critical. \r\n\r\nEventually we had lunch and the day ended with having 3 regular interviews soft skills, technical, soft skills. \r\n\r\nOne of the most challenging and nerve-wrecking experiences of all my interviews.",

Interviewer even couldn\u2019t put the question in sensible way, when I started answering he mentioned no that\u2019s not what I asked and instantly started explaining to me and when I asked back that you were asking me this, how could I put it that way!

Include:\r\n- Numerical Reasoning (45 min): Be careful 'units'\r\n- Verbal Reasoning (45 min): For non-English native speakers, I'll suggest applicants read as fast as you can because there are so many questions!\r\n- Personality questionnaire (25 min)\r\n- Video English Assessment: Make sure the website really saves your video or they can't give you english score.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] AC\r\nThere are three parts in AC, group case interview, role play and individual interview. Before you go to AC, you should have a basic understanding about it (Search it online!). I've seen so many candidates be panic in AC and failed to the final. If you can good at being the leader, good! Go take it! But if you can't, don't worry about that. You still can take other job in the group. Try to be yourself and don't say stupid or unorganized things. It will make you be challenged later in individual interview.\r\n\r\nThe position I apply is technical consultant, so the case is more close to a real system implementation problem. You don't need to understand all products becasue they'll assign you do some researches before AC. For sales/marketing applicants, your case will be simulate a sales/marketing campaigns.\r\n\r\n[4] Final interview\r\nIn final, it's all individual interview. You need to do case presentation alone and then they'll aske some questions about it. After that, you need to do competency interview.\r\n\r\n* Although the position I applied is related to technical, they didn't test my coding ability. They care more about yourself. So don't worry about that.\r\n* I really love Microsoft recruiting process. HR not only updated every step by email but also did the confirmation by phone. YES! They did it every time!\r\n* Comparing to banking and consulting firms. I'll say the interview is really not hard.",

    "review": "I was referred by a friend who had started 4 months prior. I applied for the CSA position on careers.microsoft.com. Having an internal referral seemed to help me get my foot in the door. Once referred, a recruiter contacted me to make sure my information was up to date as well as offer their assistance if there were other jobs for which I'd like to apply.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter the hiring manager contacted me to chat about the position and to make sure I was still interested. He also mentioned another position that was similar but not yet posted. I was interested in both positions after the conversation.\r\n\r\nA couple weeks later, I talked to an interview scheduler who wanted to ensure I'd be free on an upcoming Friday. They were planning on doing the interview in their regional office which is about 3 hours from my home. I was free and they said they'd get back to me in a day or two. About a week passed until I heard back that they had decided to do the interviews in my city after all. I was scheduled for an interview on a Friday in late April.\r\n\r\nI arrived for the interview early wearing a suit with no tie. All the posts I've read said that they don't care a whole lot about what you wear, but dress nice and be comfortable. I did not feel under dressed during the process and I was more comfortable sans tie.\r\n\r\nI met with 4 individuals including the hiring manager, a technical resource, a sales representative and another individual. My last interviewer had told me to wait around because the hiring manager wanted to talk to me again. I think some wires were crossed because I waited 45 minutes and was about to leave when I happened to see the hiring manger in the hall and was able to ask him if he was still wanting to chat. He seemed surprised but obliged and we talked for a bit longer. They were all obviously interested in chatting about the two roles (one of which I had formally applied for and one that was not \"yet\" posted). Overall, I had a really good feeling about it all and was optimistic that I would hear back from them with good news. After all, I had essentially interviewed for two positions at once and all feedback so far was great.\r\n\r\nI was told at the start of this that I'd hear back from the recruiter(s) within 10 business days after the interviews one way or another. I had 2 contacts that were given to me earlier and expected to hear from one of them. After 7 days I was getting a bit impatient and reached out via email. I did not hear back, which was fine since I still had a few days to go. I emailed the recruiters periodically over the next 2 to 3 weeks. The 2 recruiters did not get back to me, but the interview scheduler was responsive and was working on my behalf to get the recruiters to call me. I appreciated her very much during this process.\r\n\r\n4 weeks after the interview I had still not heard back from anyone. I was getting a little frustrated by this time and decided it wouldn't hurt to contact the hiring manager directly. We had talked on the phone and emailed before the interview so I didn't feel like this was huge breach of protocol. I emailed the hiring manger and the recruiters separately on the same day, for what I assumed would be the last time. I didn't plan on drawing the process out anymore at this time.\r\n\r\nI heard back from the recruiter the next day with his sincerest apologies for how long this had taken. He scheduled a phone call to discuss my interview and application process for the next day. We had the phone call and it was helpful, but he was unable to tell me if I was moving forward or not. He told me all the feedback was positive and that he was going to reach out to the hiring manager to get more information.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the hiring manager emailed me back apologizing as well for the slow turn around, but he alluded to the recruiting team dropping the ball. He asked if I wanted to have a phone call later that day or the next morning. I emailed him back immediately stating I was free after 1 o'clock that day or I could open up my morning the next day. I never heard back from him.\r\n\r\nI reached out to the recruiter a week later since he had still not contacted me as promised. No reply. I reached out to the hiring manager one last time 3 weeks later to no avail.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, (2 1/2 months since my interview) the friend who originally referred me contacted me to tell me he had just heard the position was filled by an internal candidate. By this time, I was just glad to get some closure.\r\n\r\nOverall, leading up to and including the interview was very positive. After the interview the lack of feedback and letting me hang in the wind was pretty unprofessional. Especially since they stated several times that I'd hear back either way. Thankfully, I am employed. I would be very upset had I continued to hold out hope for this position while between jobs.",

Despite some issues, it's the best interview process I have been through so far. \r\n\r\nHad a phone screen with a third party recruiter. She asked a bunch of stock standard questions (behavioral focused plus reviewing work history) and a few out of the box questions about your thoughts on Microsoft. From there I went straight onto the onsite interview process with about 50 other MBA candidates. Microsoft does \"wine and dine\" their potentials - you fly in, participate in a meet and greet networking dinner event, get an allowance to use for sightseeing, etc. The interview day is a loop interview and you are passed through about 4-5 different people. Interviews were straight forward and more conversational around my work history and my thoughts on Microsoft. \r\n\r\nWhere they can make improvements is around the transparency and focus on job roles. It's not entirely clear what role you are interviewing for since each person gets about 4-5 different potential job roles and verticals that they can slot into. Makes for a nightmare in terms of preparations. One of the candidates didn't even know what vertical or job he was interviewing for since his recruiter did not provide him any information. This was a general sentiment amongst most candidates I spoke to. Despite this, the process itself was one of the best I experienced amongst all my interviews.",

About a week later I heard back from Microsoft via email and was invited to a presentation the day before the interviews to ease our nerves. The presentation pretty much foreshadowed my demise for the interview. \r\n\r\nOn Microsoft's website, they advertised that the position of Program Manager does not require the applicant to be well-versed in programming. However, during the presentation we were told the exact opposite and to expect programming questions during the interview. Seeing as I was a mechanical engineer student and my weakest point is programming (data structures and such since those are not taught in my course work) this was leading to a train wreck. \r\n\r\nOn interview day,  it was a pretty speedy process. The interview took a total of 30 minutes. The employees that held the presentation the day before are the ones interviewing in my case. As expected, the first question I get is a data structure question. Explained to the interviewer my position and lack of programming experience and was still dragged through those questions for an additional 10 minutes. At that point, it was clear from the interviewer's body language and facial ticks that I was no longer being considered for a follow-up. The interviewer then switched to product design since that was also expected in the position. Tried recovering the interview at this point since product design is my forte but the interviewer was very disconnected and disinterested in my responses. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the interview ended poorly from a surprise misinformation on their job posting. The interviewer also didn't make it any easier when I let them know my current position and their attitude through the interview. The whole experience left a bad taste for me and  I probably will not apply to this company again unless approached and fully informed on their expectations in whatever job opening.",

    "review": "[TLDR: The worst interview experience of my life. The Microsoft recruitment team did a terrible job.]\r\n\r\nI met with a recruiter on my university's campus in October 2015 and gave her my resume. I told her I was interested in a hardware intern position but she set me up with an interview for the software internship instead. I asked her about it in an email response and she told me that if I could get a job in software, I could just switch to hardware once I got there for the summer. I had an on-campus interview which seemed to go well. Mostly behavioral and experiential questions with one coding question. The interviewer kept cutting my responses off which was unsettling. \r\n\r\nI followed up with a thank you and my recruiter told me I would hear back in 3 weeks. 3 weeks goes by and I still haven't heard a response so I send a follow up. The recruiter gets back to me and tells me to wait two more weeks. I don't get a response in two weeks so I send a follow up.  The recruiter tells me I move on to the next round of interviews and connects me to a new recruiter. The new recruiter tells me that I will be interviewing in person and that I should be in contact with a scheduler within the next two weeks to set up an interview time. I told her about my situation about wanting to work in hardware and she said that it should be fine. The scheduler sends me an email asking for three dates that I could make it during which she tells me I will be interviewing in Raleigh, NC. I give the three dates and she responds with a form for me to fill out with the final date. This is beginning/mid January 2016 at this point). I don't hear any confirmation on my flight or hotel within two weeks (end of January 2016). I send a follow up and the scheduler responds saying she had been sending to the wrong email address (I'm very frustrated at this point). She also says that there are no more positions in Raleigh so I will be interviewing in Seattle....\r\n\r\nI finally get flight confirmation and I'm in Seattle and have confirmation for my first interview at 11am the next morning. I wake up early around 8am and luckily so because around 8:25am I get a call from my scheduler saying she told me the wrong time and location of my interview. I was actually supposed to meet with a recruiter at 8:30am at a location that was 30min away from my hotel. I have two and a half heart attacks and tell her I don't have transportation and she tells me to grab a Microsoft shuttle. She also reassures me that this won't count against me and she has alerted my interviewers of the mistake. I quickly get ready and make it to the first interview by 9:20am. I unfortunately never got to meet with a recruiter so I didn't even know what team I was interviewing with when I got there. I found out I am meeting with CDM (load management) from my first interviewer because I had to ask and I felt unprepared and unprofessional about that. Before I had been told that I was just interviewing for Microsoft in general and not a specific team, but my interviewer tells me up front I am interviewing for an internship with the CDM team (remember that I wanted to be in hardware in the first place and was told I could switch if I got the job). He gave me a schedule for the rest of the day and the interviews seemed to go well from there.  I had three 50-min interviews back to back, and lunch was right after my second interview. The questions were all iterating through arrays in some way or another. Pretty standard questions, but considering I am a computer engineering student with a focus in computer architecture, I felt out of my comfort zone (remember that I wanted a hardware position in the first place). All three interviewers were nice, but they didn't ask any behavioral questions and one or two experiential questions which tells me that they are just ultimately looking for code monkeys instead of collaborators and innovators. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I was told to go meet the recruiter that I was originally supposed to meet with in the morning back at the recruitment building. When I get there and check in, I am told he is too busy and to send him an email with my thoughts of how it went. He sends a quick response telling me I will hear back within a week. Two days later I get a formal no from him saying that I should wait a year to apply before reapply for a position at Microsoft.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was the most horrible interviewing experience that I have ever had, and probably anyone will ever have at Microsoft. I see this case as an anomaly for the company, but I feel obligated to share my feedback. I felt like they weren't even going to hire me and they were just hoping that along the way I would give up and not follow up. What a waste of my time and energy and a waste of the interviewers' time as well considering I didn't even want the position they were interviewing me for.",

All interviewers are very experienced engineers/managers with 10+ years of experience.\r\n- Got my offer after 2 days.

    "review": "I applied online and was contacted by a recruiter 2 weeks later. The interview had following phases:\r\n\r\n- Call with HR to talk about what I was looking for, why I wanted to change jobs etc.\r\n\r\n- Next was a call with the hiring manager. General questions and answers about the role, my background etc. \r\n\r\n- A technical phone screening. After this screening I was invited to come onsite. \r\n\r\nThe HR gave me a tentative schedule for the interview day. (I did not know at that time but found out later that this is sort of the Microsoft process to initially only schedule 3 or 4 interviews and add other interviews if you do well in the first few rounds.)\r\n\r\n- So I had first four interviews starting from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. There was a lunch in between for 30 minutes with hiring manager and a 30 minute break later on. After each interview, the interviewer would escort me to a common waiting area and bring the next interviewer with them a few minutes later. \r\n\r\nSince I only had 4 interviews scheduled, I was pretty much ready to go home at 3 PM. But learnt from the hiring manager that they had one more person who wanted to speak to me. I was led to that person's office and spoke to them for another hour. At this point I was almost completely exhausted and ready to go home but was told that there was just one more person yet. This was probably the hardest interview of all. In the end I learnt that it was an 'as appropriate' interview. I would leave the task of figuring out what 'as appropriate' interview is to the reader. Anyway so finally at 5PM they let me go. \r\n\r\nOverall three onsite interviews were purely technical and two were mix of program management and technical questions and one was behavioral or you could say 'culture fit' assessment. \r\n\r\nI was contacted by HR within a week with an offer. The offer was pretty good so I did not negotiate.",

Got a callback from said rec. agents - 1st week in the New year.\r\n3. Was informed of a scheduled 1hr. phone-interview a week later.\r\n4. Phone interview was successful and consisted largely of 'ownership' aka telling the story of every role on my cv to the client, being prompted accordingly by scenarios whereever the client wanted to get a better handle of my experiences.\r\n5. A 2.5hour Facetoface interview with 3 colleagues in Reading a week later.\r\n  - 1st colleague: direct report on client project I would be attached to (real life scenarios on project)\r\n  - 2nd colleague: Software testing division lead (logical thinking)\r\n  - 3rd colleague: PM on project I would be attached to (team fit)\r\n\r\nQuestions from phone interview:\r\n  1. Tell me about your proudest role to date.\r\n  2. Tell me about challenges experienced on any projects and how you navigated the situation(s).\r\n  3. Typically what size teams have you managed\r\n  4. What would you say was the split of your responsibilities on previous roles?\r\n  5.

'He' did all the talking afterwards and indirectly answered his question. Checkout Harvard review '5 whys?' on youtube]\r\n  6. Here's a scenario on a project, you find a major defect with an app. at the tail end of a project you're on and alert the PM, but the PM being concerned about quality entry /exit criteria e.g. No sev. 1s, 5 sev. 2s etc, set on the project which might affect go-Live/delivery timelines on the project; requests that the new bug not be included on the burndown chart /list of found work for the proj. in order that go-Live isn't impacted. What dyou do? (Hint: emphasise on achieving both i.e. reporting every issue for the highest quality /investigation & delivering the project on time.)\r\netc and the likes.\r\n\r\nI've found that talking about the relevant details of:\r\n\r\n - little details of my previous projects e.g. pattern of major issues resulting from 'friday' deploymnt at a newspaper client \r\n - everything I learnt from pushing my daughter's buggy on the way to her creche e.g. the stroll will take as fast/slow as I choose to walk, \r\n - the book I'm reading e.g. Mythical man month: That a woman delivers a baby in 9mnths, does not mean 3women will deliver the same baby in 3months \r\n - my choir event last night e.g. an uninvolved/little experienced tenor singing, soprano, might cause a conflict of interest.\r\n - the bitter relationship lessons I'm learning, e.g. must grow and share with the special one & home team\r\n - the holiday I had with my wife last month e.g. Date with destiny event attended in Florida.\r\n - racing with my fitbit buddies etc e.g. realising, though I love running and think it's easy for me, it really isn't easy - but that I've only learnt how to accept the rituals I perfome (stretch, lay awake for an hour before getting out of bed, stretch, conquer the fear, pick a destination & determine to get back: take no phone/money or bus pass etc) AND that if I was finding any aspects of my life difficult, I was probably underestimating the amount of rituals /work I needed to develop and get accustomed to.\r\n\r\netc\r\n\r\nThis sort of stuff, make it a relationship, say to yourself: \"this person likes me; now what have they just said and how can I respond intelligently OR what can I say to entertain them about this subject?\"",

But days after that another recruiter contacted me. The entire process from phone interview arrangement, on-site interview to final feedback lasts another 1 month.\r\n\r\nI had 1 phone interview with simple C++ question. And for the on-site interview I met 5 interviewers at Redmond site. It started with a brief conversation with the recruiter. After that the first interviewer took me to lunch and then just interview me after lunch. All the interviews are conducted in a meeting room. There's one 30min break in the afternoon, and for that break I had to exit the office area and just wait and relax at the reception lobby. The difficulty of the interview questions are slightly above average, but fair enough for this position.\r\n\r\nBecause C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, one of my friend who works at Microsoft suggested me to interview with my working language instead. But just in case I still practiced C++ for some days before on-site. And I was right, because all of the interviewers asked me to use C++ for white board coding.\r\n\r\nI was also told that Microsoft usually replies fast after interview, and that's true for my case. Just 1 week after on-site the recruiter called me and told me that they will not continue the process. He also told me that my biggest flaw was the fluency of C++. Despite they're aware of the fact that C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, from hindsight it seems to me that Microsoft really emphasize on the proficiency of C/C++/C# despite other qualification, which I'll definitely take extra care before my next application to Microsoft.",

After a day, I was contacted several times for additional information, and the following day I was invited for a face-to-face interview.  I was hoping for a phone interview prior to an immediate face-to-face interview.  So, I travelled down to KL for this appointment, and the interviewers were surprised that I wasn't stationed in KL.  The Adecco consultant should've pre-informed them about this, which probably he didn't.\r\n\r\nThe face-to-face interview felt somewhat awkward.  Only a handful of questions were asked.  I took the initiative to prolong the interview so that I could try to gain more points and paint a fuller picture of my capabilities.  But, eventually, I felt the interviewers wanted me out of the door sooner, which was rather an unprofessional approach coming from them.  I left with the feeling that they only wanted to gauge me on the surface, and not taking any effort in understanding me deeper.\r\n\r\nEventually, my realisation came to be.  I was unsuccessful.  Reason is that they are looking for someone who is well-versed in e-commerce.  I've much more than its required.  If they continue prejudging me and/or applicants like book covers, then this position will never be filled.  It's their own short-sightedness for not taking the initiative to knowing others better.\r\n\r\nI truly wasted my effort, time, and resources for this sure-unsuccessful face-to-face interview.  For goodness sake, Microsoft, please coach your managers/directors to have greater empathy and respect towards job applicants.

Microsoft treats its interns very well by arranging for travel to Seattle and providing a very lenient budget for meals. \r\n\r\nI was invited to a social the evening before my interview day. I would highly recommend attending the social. The social helped me feel comfortable and learn a lot about Microsoft in general. You get to meet previous interns/current employees as well as the people you will be interviewing with. Its a great experience overall. It helps you get over your nervousness and come prepared on the interview day.\r\n\r\nMy interview consisted of three onsite interviews. The first one was mainly technical. The interviewer confirmed if I knew certain concepts before he asked me the question(s). The second interview was technical as well. However, this interview was not coding on the whiteboard. It was technical questions based on my resume. The third interview was with a PM. \r\n\r\nOverall, Microsoft really puts in the effort to ensure that interns have an amazing experience.

A week later during the evening I got an email and a phone call saying I got an interview on my college campus, but I have to accept within the hour and it would be in the morning at 9 AM. So I went and we mostly discussed my experience and a tech question on the conceptual level. A couple weeks after that I got invited to go to Redmond, but unfortunately I had to reschedule due to midterms. I got assigned to a new scheduler and it took him a month to fit me into the \"perfect interview experience\" after I had to keep reminding him via email. So I finally fly out to Redmond which was awesome since it's totally free. 9 PM at night before the interview, I still don't know what team I'm interviewing for or what time I'm meeting with my recruiter. Apparently the email with all that information never got sent to me. Anyway, I figure all that out and find out right before the interviews that I'm interviewing with a team who's product I've never used. During the interviews they didn't seem to like that my experience was focused on programming devices or interfacing with devices which wasn't my fault because the HR should have had me interviewing with a team better suited for my resume. They said I will get my decision within a week. Surprise, surprise over a week goes by and I have to remind the recruiter to give me the bad news.",

    "review": "From beginning to end, this was one of the most aloof interview processes I've ever been a part of. I applied online and didn't hear back until 3 weeks after, which was fine since I was willing to wait for Microsoft. But what was most egregious was that my recruiter was nonexistent throughout the process, it literally felt like a robot was just sending me things to sign and never actually interacting with me. I sent multiple emails asking questions and even leaving voicemails, which went completely unanswered. It wasn\u2019t until I asked the interview coordinator (yes, a different person) who finally helped me get in contact with my supposed recruiter. She apologized and then promised to call me back, which again she never did (oh well). On the day of the virtual onsite, my first interviewer asked about how a JavaScript bundler works, which produced some awkwardness because I was not a frontend developer. He noted this and quickly pivoted the discussion to my Java experience, which made things even more awkward because my background wasn't in Java either (LOL). Clearly, he didn\u2019t review my resume/profile. The next interviewer was friendly but obviously not a native English speaker. We talked about situations where I had encountered disagreements and what I did to overcome them (pretty standard). We proceeded to the coding challenge and I recognized how a stack can be used to solve my problem. She tells me unless I can articulate clearly how I use the stack, I can\u2019t use it. Okay\u2026 well, I tell her that I\u2019m not 100% sure but sometimes having the code written down lets me visualize it and brainstorm better (we have our unique ways of doing things). Nope, not allowed to do it. I end up going with a brute force implementation which she obviously did not want. For the third interviewer, we get into the system design portion and I start drawing and talking about my approach. Again, it's hard to understand what they were asking (English not being their first language). In the end, they ding me for not asking enough clarification questions and not explaining my idea before jumping into the implementation. Sure, because I can certainly read minds and know what everyone's expectations are *sarcasm*. If you don't outline what your expectations are for the candidate, you can't fault them for making certain assumptions and taking liberties with their answer. Anyways, at this point, I\u2019ve had enough and I email the coordinator to withdraw my candidacy. I can honestly say this was unequivocally the worst and most unorganized interview I\u2019ve ever been a part of.",

There was no possibility to contact him via call and he seemed to be in his own world.

I gave him a chance and he organised call with the recruiting Manager/ Head of customer success. The manager although being department head forgot about the interview and was 40 mins late in the interview. I found it very unprofessional from her side. She offered me another time for an interview and the interview process was quite random. It was just disappointing overall experience and I did not expect that from a company like Microsoft. It felt like the interview process was carried forward just for the sake of doing interviews.

The interview went well and was basically a discussion. Presentation of the Supply Chain and Manufacturing group and the positions  within the group. He also asked me situational questions such as how do you work in teams or how often do you interact with your superior/professor during projects. About 4 weeks later, I was flown to Redmond,WA for a panel of interviews. 3 days all paid by Microsoft. We were a big group of several backgrounds (mostly Mechanical and Electrical engineering), all applying for an internship or full time in the Manufacturing group. The day before the interviews, we visited the campus and went to diner to meet employees of the group. It was really nice and casual. On the interview day I was part of the afternoon shift. We went to lunch on campus (paid by Microsoft) and then proceeded to the interviews. There was 4 of them, 45 min separated by a 15min break. All my interviews were strictly behavioral (surprisingly!) and I mostly talked about previous projects I had worked on and why I'd like to work there. My advice is, know your resume, be enthusiastic and ask a lot of (interesting/relevant) questions. Really show that you want this. They're not here to trick you but rather test how you'd fit in the group/company. After the interviews we went back to the hotel and went to visit Seattle with a group of interviewees (all expenses paid again). They told us we'd hear from them within 3-5 business days. I got an email the day after coming back home, saying I had an offer and then the HR scheduled a call to discuss the letter content. Overall, the process took about 7 weeks and went smoothly.

There was 4 -5 rounds of this. This started at 8:30 am in their Dublin office so they could have time to go through everyone.

They got my first name right but last name was just a jumble of letters,  have a pretty normal Irish name so they must not have been able to read my writing.  Each of the interviews started with talking about past internships I did, the role I had in them and development I did as part of them. The questions asked were normal for the most part. \r\n\r\nThere was some stand out moments though: \r\n\r\n- asked an interview what they likes/enjoyed about the time at work at Microsoft, they replied that it was different for every one and proceeded to skip it. \r\n- one of the interviews forgot my name (remember name tag was on), same interviewer had to go to the toilet as soon as the round began, lost interview time with this.

ATTEMPTS AT CONTACTING RECRUITERS HAVE RESULTED IN NOTHING.  No rejection email or phone call, no anything.  \r\n\r\nI was contacted by a recruiter, and after two phone interviews, was flown into Dallas for an in-person interview.  The person I was supposed to meet didn't attend due to heavy rain, and I ended up being interviewed by 3 different people (1 who called me and interviewed over the phone).  \r\n\r\nI received positive feedback from all 3 interviewers, and was told I could expect to hear back in 5 to 10 business days.  \r\n\r\nMicrosoft PAID for my flight and hotel.  As of now, 5 weeks later, I have received zero feedback from anyone at the company.  My attempts at emailing have typically resulted in no response, except for the fact that the original recruiter is no longer with his staffing company and I was dumped onto someone else.  \r\n\r\nI am furious that I took valuable time away from my family to travel to an in-person interview and not have the courtesy of a single phone call or email communication from anyone at the company.  \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I would have gotten an offer if somebody at the company didn't completely screw up, but instead I've received zero communication.  \r\n\r\nI'm blown away by the lack of professionalism and courtesy by Microsoft for not having the decency to follow up with candidates at all.  \r\n\r\nMy time is my most valuable commodity, and I will never trust Microsoft with it again.  I'm a cloud technology and data expert, and Microsoft wanted me to help them with supporting Azure clients.  I was abundantly qualified to do so, and if they ever contact me again I will absolutely not waste my time with them.

I passed that interview and was flown out to Seattle for final round interviews. They pay for everything they can and then reimburse you for everything else, including food and a small stipend for site seeing, so the trip was great. The day of the interview everyone showed up at 7:30am for a quick breakfast (fruit, rolls, bagels, etc) in a common area. There were about 40 other candidates being interviewed during that time. About 60% female, 40% male. And about 60% Indian, 25% Asian, and 15% Caucasian. Then we each had four 45 minutes interviews, with 15 minute breaks between each one. Two of the interviewers are from one team in Microsoft and the other two are from another team. They make hiring decisions independent of one another so you could theoretically get offers from both teams (or none). Of the four of us interview candidates from my university, we all seemed to be interview by entirely different teams. (How they determined what teams you would be interviewing with was somewhat of a mystery to us.) Unfortunately for me, both the teams I interviewed with were in charge of back-end development.

The person I talked to specifically was pretty down the earth and very honest about his opinions of the company and the work he does, so that was a refreshing change from someone trying to drown me kool-aid. I was contacted about a week later regarding an on campus interview. \r\n\r\nThe on campus interview was, if I remember correctly, 20, maybe 30, minutes long. It was about 10 minutes of behavioral questions that was all pretty standard. Team experience, personal projects, a brief QA. Following from that, we did 1 technical question. The one I received was fairly basic and I communicated directly to the interviewer that I knew the answer immediately. From that he permitted me to write it in pythonic pseudo code for my solution. We then discussed why it was the best solution as well as other, worse solutions, to the problem. All in all a good experience. The interviewer seemed interested in me and treated me like someone actually suited to interview for the company. I received an invitation to interview on site the following week.\r\n\r\nScheduling my onsite was a bit of a pain and from what I understand from my friends, they had similar experiences. The communication with the recruiting manager was great, but because of how responsibilities are tossed around at MSFT, it took a long time for my flight and other things to get confirmed and even when I was told I would be receiving the information on them, I never received them.

The food was great, but unfortunately you spend most of your time getting to know the other candidates and Microsoft employees so there isn't too much time to enjoy the buffet style food. This was very helpful and eased my nerves as everyone at Microsoft was friendly and easy to speak with. Left dinner around 9, went back to hotel to glance over my resume one last time and get a full night sleep before needing to be at the office for 4 hours of interviews at 7:30 the next morning. \r\n\r\nYou are interviewing for the Support Engineer OR Premier Field Engineer role, and it is my understanding that Microsoft will determine which role you would be a better fit for and extend you an offer for that role. From my understanding, the main difference is that Support Engineers need more technical depth while PFE's need more technical breadth and spend the majority of their working hours traveling and visiting customers on site. \r\n\r\nAs for the interview - Microsoft is genuinely interested in finding out if you will be a good fit for the company, so relax and be yourself. The 3 month MACH training program all PFE and SE new hires go through is apparently pretty tech-intensive and very thorough, so the interview seemed to be less technical and more behavioral as Microsoft believes it can teach any intelligent, driven individual how to succeed in the role.",

Despite the rental car, a bus was available on the morning of the interview to bring me to Microsoft's campus so I didn't have to worry about driving.\r\n\r\nThe interview itself consisted of lunch, followed by 4 45-minute interviews. Between each interview was a 15 minute break to get snacks and drinks - this was extremely helpful in making this process easier.\r\n\r\nAfterwords, the recruiter informed me that I would hear back by the end of that week, and then actually got back even earlier than that - this was great as I didn't spend a long time waiting for a response like with other companies.\r\n\r\nVery well done interview process.",

Both interviews were extremely pleasant. The interviewers were genuinely nice, and allowed me plenty of time for me to ask them questions about the team and the role I would play. \r\n\r\nIn terms of actual questions, the research-y team had most of the interviewers asking me about my ideas on the research problems they were trying to solve, with only one actual \"coding\" interview, which dealt with the standard tree traversal questions, and the design for a battleship game, with the challenge question being about how to scale up the battleship game to a large grid. The other team had more coding style questions, but most of them were not about writing code per se, but more of designing data structures and algorithms to solve specific problems in distributed sorting, google doc style spreadsheets, etc. Lots of puzzle/brainteaser questions from this team as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, a great interview experience!",

They also want to specifically find out if you would fit into the company culture and whether you have a general understanding of Microsoft products and solutions. It could consist of anything you would typically expect from an HR interview including tell me about yourself and why are you interested in Microsoft. The Second round was a situation where you are expected to create two PowerPoints on How you fit with Microsoft and Why you are a good candidate for the role you are applying to. The Third round was a case study with one of the senior managers at Microsoft. You would be provided with a case that could have been for a Microsoft customer (a sales situation). You would be asked to prepare a pitch or you could be asked questions related to how you would handle a sales situation. The key is that you must be very familiar with a lot of Microsoft products and solutions. Your case study could be related to any one of the products in the Microsoft ecosystem. In the final round, you will have a short interview with a regional head. He will ask you sales questions such as: do you prefer to sell 10 solutions to a few customers or would you prefer to sell one solution to a hundred customers.",

I thought it was just a really nice way of saying \"thanks, but no thanks.\"\r\n\r\nFast forward to Fall 2015, when my recruiter emailed me and asked me if I would like to go to Redmond for interviews since the on campus interview went well last year. I went, and I must say that I was very impressed with Microsoft. They drove us potential University Recruits to their campus in a Limo!\r\n\r\nThe interview process was four 45-minute interviews in a row, with a 15 minute break between each one. I was surprised that I was being interviewed for a group that did higher level programming even though I have studied more low-level programming in recent years because I'm a Computer Engineering student. I think some of the other interviewees who were looking for higher level jobs were confused too, because they interviewed most of them for the operating systems track. I'm not sure if there was a mix-up or not!\r\n\r\nThe interviews themselves were very engaging and the interviewers presented challenging questions. I strongly suspect that one of the people who was interviewing me was texting while I had my back turned and was talking through a problem on the whiteboard, but the rest of it went pretty well.

    "review": "Worst job interview process ever (really unbelievable horror story):\r\n\r\nI was asked to apply by a friend and MSFT employee who knew I was looking for a new opportunity. He forwarded my resume to their recruitment department. Next I was contacted through LinkedIn by a recruiter telling me he was contacting me on behalf of Microsoft. I was wary as I had included my contact details (phone number, e-mail address) in my resume and nothing on the LinkedIn profile of this recruiter stated he was actually working for MSFT.\r\n\r\nWhile I used my contact at MSFT to verify that this recruiter was legit and contacting me as a result of my application, this 'recruiter' mad his next move: He called my current employer. Explained that he was calling on behalf of MSFT and had a referral from <name MSFT employee> and wanted to be put through to me. The telephone operator from my current employer called me and explained the situation. I went in full damage control and refused to take the call stating I was not interviewing for new jobs.\r\n\r\nI reported this anomaly to my MSFT contact which resulted in a phone call by the recruiter offering his apologies and I had my first interview with him. The interview consisted of some general questions and ended with the promise I would soon be invited to a face-to-face interview at MSFT HQ NL. \r\n\r\nIn the next two weeks nothing happened. So I contacted the recruiter again. He stated he turned over my application to another recruiter and he would give him a nudge. After hearing nothing in the following two weeks I contacted MSFT again. This time they denied the existence of the recruiter who had contacted me. After I had relayed this message to my contact @MSFT I got another telephone interview with a senior recruiter. After passing these hurdles I got a telephone interview with the hiring manager. Apparently the hiring manager was impressed and we planned a face-to-face interview which would include a case interview as well. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately on the date the interview was scheduled the hiring manager could not fly in (he was working from Finland) I was only told when I arrived at MSFT HQ NL. I was however greeted very warmly by another manager who joined the subsequent skype interview. The room had a peculiar setup which included a \u2018power seat\u2019 which I prudently avoided sitting in.\r\nThe skype interview seemed a bit redundant after the phone interview. \r\n\r\nHowever after a pleasant interview it was decided I would move on to the case interview. I was given an a4 with some general content about a company and some of their challenges. I was asked to prepare myself to engage some executives and interest them in moving some of their business to Azure. I could take as much prep time as I wanted. I took 5 minutes to read the case and decide on a subject, went to the bathroom and informed them I was ready for the case interview.\r\n\r\nThe case interview was attended by two MSFT managers in person and the hiring manager on Skype. One manager played CFO, the other COO and the hiring manager the Enterprise Architect. I chose to focus on the most simple solution I could sell them, avoided going into a tech discussion with the architect and took away the opportunity to come back to them with a proposal for a POC.\r\n\r\nFeedback: Great job. Only point of feedback: Don\u2019t become too greedy (I sold them on two products who I thought were a strong combo), but they would have preferred an even simpler sell. I was told they were impressed and would get back to me within one week.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks I got on the phone and reached the hiring manager who told me there was no direct opening available, but that he was going to get back to me within the next month with a job offer. After that month I called him again and got the answer that there had been a reorganization and he would remind his successor about my application. \r\n\r\nThey did not get back to me after that. I gave up \u2026 Too soon? Too late? I don\u2019t know. In any case I think it will be hard to worsen the process. If MSFT is interested in names or proof, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nShame on you MSFT!",

Had an awesome time. All the interviewers were extremely friendly and all seemed genuinely interested in talking about the previous projects I've worked on.",

After applying through the MS Careers site, I was contacted within a few days by a recruiter and we began discussing what the role entailed, a brief description of myself and career experience, as well as goals/motivation for seeking the new position. The same day, they scheduled a phone screening with the hiring manager.\r\n\r\nI got a reply back the next day from the recruiter and we discussed further the interview process, scheduling options, and the duration of the process. This all happened within 5 days.\r\n\r\nThe following week I went in for the on-site interview and met with the hiring manager who I'd spoken to on the phone. We reviewed what was going to happen during the day, then he handed me off to the first interviewer. We spent a good amount of time talking about the fundamental power supply topologies and discussed our common experience having gone to the same graduate school.\r\n\r\nWhen we were finished, I got to share lunch with the next interviewer, an engineer who would tentatively be my peer in the group. Rapport was also good here. I was able to teach him a few things about the fundamentals of some electronics circuits and he seemed genuinely interested in what I could bring to the team. This all why eating; no pressure.\r\n\r\nNext was a director of another group, parallel to the hiring manager. There was little formality to this (which kept nerves in check) and his questions primarily dealt with subject matter outside of my experience so he was surprisingly gracious with expectations. He was, as was the case through most of the day, seeking how I solved the problems, not so much the exact answers.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I met with another engineer who would be my peer in another group. We discussed best practices of board layout and general circuit design. Again, good interaction, though not as technical as the prior discussion. He's a very quiet person, so I wasn't able to read his reactions in the interview itself, but I felt confident throughout.\r\n\r\nAnother engineer; rinse & repeat. Pretty much the same questions as the previous person.\r\n\r\nThen I met again with the hiring manager who gave me some more technical questions than he'd previously asked. I was able to satisfactorily walk through the questions despite having not worked on such a circuit in some time.\r\n\r\nFinally, I met the skip-level manager of the department. He was immediately enthusiastic about my then-employer and discussed a bunch of previous encounters with them. Then he handed me a piece of paper that showed a circuit he'd previously worked on and asked me how it operated. Again, I was able to satisfactorily answer these questions. He had a meeting immediately following so I was sort of unceremoniously dismissed for the day without being able to talk further with the previous interviewers or even being escorted out of the lobby. I went home that day with a pretty good feeling about how it all went, but wasn't sure how to handle the exit.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was only 2 days later that I received a job offer from the recruiter and we discussed what the next steps were and when I could start. All told, the entire process from application to receiving an offer was about 2 weeks.",

What I was surprised about was that the interviews were interviews with a total of four hiring managers AND three other candidates for the same position.  Each candidate was shuttled off to separate conference rooms and the hiring managers took turns interviewing each candidate.  Sandwiches were graciously offered for each candidate.  One of the hiring managers came in while I was eating and I had to choke down my sandwich while he asked me questions.  He did not appear to be impressed, but I was eating the sandwich that Microsoft provided and he ate one as well while we were chatting.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the interviews, I was informed that they would be a making a group decision and they would be in touch regardless of the decision.

I found out later by checking the Microsoft website that the position has been filled.

This took me aback at first, but the interviewer said I would be working as a developer, so I decided to continue with the interview process when they invited me to fly out for another round in Redmond. \r\n\r\nThe process of scheduling the interview was a bit difficult and I ended up going right in the middle of my semester final exams because they couldn't accommodate another time. That said, they were very attentive and detail-oriented when it came to scheduling drivers and hotels to make my trip as painless as possible.\r\n\r\nThe day of the interview I went with a group of other prospective interns to the campus recruiting building at Microsoft, where we got a brief introduction to the interview process and were then sent off to our first individual interviews. There were 4 interviews in total, with each interview clocking in around 45 minutes and involving a mix of interpersonal and technical questions. Interviewers drew on my resume to find starting points for the different technical questions, and though I often felt like I didn't quite reach some of the conclusions they were after, I had great conversations with the interviewers about the challenges involved in each one.\r\n\r\nI received an offer two weeks later and accepted shortly thereafter.",

That was a very important key to being asked in for a face to face interview. Finally, once the interview process was complete and I was notified of a pending job offer, I had to clear a background check and credit history check. The entire process took about 5-6 weeks.",

So 14 days before I actually wanted to schedule an interview I contacted the recruiter. After being assured that my interview was scheduled, I applied for brief break from work. The interview did not happen when I had taken a leave of absense (so time off wasted!).

Unfortunately I was super super prepared for a problem solving question but he simply asked \"How does the internet work?\", which took me completely by surprised and I answered terribly.  Still I personally am not sure about asking that question for someone who is all about problem solving.

AA round was much more easier, and taking initiatives in drawing out project decks gets more points.",

There is a round of data science, this invovles some data query with SQL + using it to answer something the interviewer is asking you to do. Most likely studying your analytical side. \r\n2. A light coding round, it wasn't anything off LC but something like binary search. They check if it can run. \r\n3. and 4. these are higher ups in the chain.

Topics tested were: string manipulations, arrays, trees, recursion. \n\nAfter submitting this test, a recruiter from Estonia contacted me via email and informed me that the process would have three interview steps with technical director and team members from Greece. \n\nFirst interview was a kind of theoretical (not so technical) with the tech director and the hiring manager. \n\nSecond one was with the Engineering Manager and asked me questions about the online test I submitted in the beggining. We also discussed alternative implementations. \n\nThird interview was the most interesting with a member of the team during which we had a broad tehnical discussion and coded online on some tasks (async programming, linq issues etc). \n\nAfter the three interview cycle was terminated, after almost two months from the first contact, and having no information about whether there would be a next step, I tried to contact the recruiting manager in Estonia with no luck(no answer to my emails). \n\nA week later, Ireceived a call from another recruiter, asking me to schedule a 4th (final) interview with the tech director (again) and another team member. During this interview, the tech director announced me that they would like to move on with an offer but they thought that I would be a good fit for another team (not the initial one for which I had applied). The team leader of the new team asked me some technical questions and everything seemed smooth. We concluded that the recruiters would contact me for the next steps. \n\nAfter two weeks of shadowing, I received an email from the recruiter informing me that my candidacy was rejected because they would like to see more theoretical knowledge (totally incosistent feedback). \n\nTo sum up, although Microsoft is considered a tech giant, its mentality towards the candidates is the worst I have ever seen.\n It is a fact that it is considered an employer of preference for lots of candidates, that's why they do not show any respect during the procedure.",

It is not. You will be passing off all deals to an Account Executive so you are essentially a BDR. I had to ask a series of questions to everyone I interviewed with to come to this conclusion and it was clear they were trying to hide the fact that the majority of what you\u2019ll be doing is setting meetings for others.\n\n3) I was told from the beginning that the process would end after my three hours of interviewing. However another interview was added once that was completed with little to no explanation as to why.\n\n4) After 3 rounds and 4+ hours of interviewing, I received an automated email mentioning that I did not get the position. After emailing and asking for feedback, I received no response\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be misleading candidates to get people with AE experience to do a BDR job, at least show some respect throughout the process",

    "review": "I interviewed there in an internal referral, after unsuccessfully applying there a few times. The people were great. I liked them and generally vibed a lot with them, but the whole process threw up a lot of red flags to me. I also learned that the company had an internal studio model where designers were farmed out to different product groups on a per-need basis, but this was not clearly communicated at any point.  \r\n\r\nI had 6 rounds of interviews with them for a junior-mid designer role, which is not standard at all. The interview panels did not share information. So when I interviewed with the 6th person, I asked him - how much longer would the process take? \r\n\r\nHe was surprised when I told him it was my sixth interview, and he responded saying, he only had my notes from the first three panels, a few weeks ago\r\n\r\nFurther, they kept making me do whiteboard interviews for some reason. I ended up doing four of those (in rounds 2, 4,5,6) which was again not at all expected for a design interview.  When I asked why, since I'd already done so many earlier, they said it was just the process. \r\n\r\nThe HR wouldn't tell me how many rounds were remaining or what is the next stage of the process, or the team I would be joining. While that process was taking place, I got an offer in hand from another company.  I accepted that and told my recruiter I was dropping out of the process.\r\n\r\nImmediately the recruiter calls me and says, hey, your offer letter is coming, we'll fast track it, please wait. Earlier the recruiter said they were waiting for feedback, they didn't know how many more rounds more were needed, and now all of a sudden the offer letter is ready?\r\n\r\nI couldn't wait! Either I proceed with the offer in hand, or I wait for the other offer which would come or would not come. I had completely lost trust at this point, and decided to go with  the other company because they seemed to actually want me.\r\n\r\nI think I burned a lot of bridges there but that's fine. If they were willing to treat me like this, then I would not want to work there.",

I was told to expect to hear back from them in 4/5 weeks when they had finished this round of recruitement. \n\n4 weeks passed and I hadn't heard a word from them, so I contacted them asking for an update, and all I received back was that I had been \"shortlisted\" for an interview. \n\n3 whole months passed, and they finally got back to me to schedule final round interviews, at this point I had already interviewed (and received offers) at other companies. When told them I had accepted an offer and wanted to withdraw my application,  they responded that I should have told them I had pending offers, and they would have sped up the process! \n\nI was in disbelief honestly with the lack of communication throughout the whole process. Perhaps, I would have asked them to speed up the process if they had been more transparent with me. I understand that they have a lot of applications to get through, but the least they can do is give rough estimates of how long the recruitment steps will take.",
